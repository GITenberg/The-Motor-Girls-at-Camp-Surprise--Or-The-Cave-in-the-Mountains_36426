<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—AN UNPLEASANT AWAKENING</h2>
<p>
“Look where you are steering, Cora Kimball!
You nearly ran over a chicken that time.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and avoiding the chicken on that side, you
nearly hit a child on this side. Such a dear little
boy—or was it a girl? I never can tell when
they’re so young.”
</p>
<p>
“Two misses are as good as two miles,” misquoted
the bronzed girl at the wheel of the automobile,
as she straightened the car on the long,
shaded road, where the trees met in a green archway
overhead, and where the golden shadows flitted
in the dust like so many little chickens running
to cover, away from the fat-tired wheels.
</p>
<p>
“Why are you in such a hurry, Cora?” asked
Bess Robinson, as she tucked back a straying lock
of brown hair. “It’s too perfect a day to do anything
in a hurry—even run a car.”
</p>
<p>
“Bess doesn’t believe in doing <em>anything</em> in a hurry,”
lazily droned her sister Belle, from the rear
seat. “That’s why she’s so fat.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t dare use that objectionable word!”
stormed Bess, turning about so suddenly that she
sent Cora’s elbow against the plunger of the horn,
thereby producing a sudden blast.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Bess. “Did we run into something
again?”
</p>
<p>
“Again?” demanded Cora. “Come, I like that—not!
We haven’t run into <em>anything</em> yet.”
</p>
<p>
“That chicken,” murmured Belle, even more
lazily. “Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“Was a good fifty feet out of danger!” declared
Cora indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“And what of the child?”
</p>
<p>
“That never <em>was</em> in danger. I didn’t see him—her
or it—until we had passed. But the child—gender
unknown—was playing in the dust beside
the road. Queer how mothers can let them.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably the mother didn’t know a thing about
it,” said Bess, who had discovered that she was
the sole cause of the needless alarm in regard to
the horn’s blast. “One can’t be always on the
lookout.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t start a discussion,” begged Cora, as a
backward glance showed some signs of Belle’s
stirring up sufficiently to refute her sister’s
remarks. “It’s too hot.”
</p>
<p>
“It is when you slow down,” observed Bess.
“But the breeze is perfectly fascinating when you
keep the car moving, Cora.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t intend to slow down right away.
Have you girls any particular desire to go to any
particular place?”
</p>
<p>
“Spare us all nerve-racking <em>particulars</em> on a day
like this,” entreated Belle, sliding down into a
more comfortable position in the big, cushioned
seat she occupied all alone. “It is so warm! Summer
is coming with a vengeance.”
</p>
<p>
“And it makes me wish we had set the date of
our departure for Camp Surprise a week or so
earlier,” remarked Cora. “I wonder if we could
arrange to go any sooner.”
</p>
<p>
“I could,” declared Bess. “I haven’t a thing
to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Except reduce,” put in her sister tantalizingly.
</p>
<p>
“Belle Robinson! If you don’t stop those mean,
insinuating remarks, I’ll—I’ll——”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t give me any more of those chocolates
you sneaked into your bag as we were coming
out,” finished Belle. “I saw you, and you
know what Dr. Blake told you would happen if
you didn’t stop eating sweets. You’ll get so——”
</p>
<p>
“These aren’t sweet!” interrupted Bess.
“They’re the bitter kind, and they’re delicious, too.
They have them so fresh at Gordon’s.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a wonder she wouldn’t give us a chance to
decide for ourselves, instead of introducing expert
testimony on her own account,” laughed Cora.
“Come, Bess, out with them!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” agreed the plump girl, with easy
grace. “I intended to share them all along, but it
was so warm——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say warm again!” drawled her sister.
“Your nose is as shiny now as a tin teakettle.”
</p>
<p>
“Belle Robinson! It is not!”
</p>
<p>
Instantly Bess had her little mirror and vanity
box in use, and a quick dab on her rather up-turned
nose did away with the condition complained of,
or at least alleged, by her sister.
</p>
<p>
“There, does that satisfy you?” she asked, turning
about for inspection, as Cora swung the big car
around a turn in the road.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m easily satisfied,” Belle murmured.
“What a perfectly gorgeous view!” she cried, as
she looked down from a height toward a village
that lay nestled in a green valley, girt around by a
winding, silvery river, glimpses of which could be
had now and then between the trees that lined the
shores.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is a good view,” agreed Cora, stopping
the car. “Cheerful Chelton looks even more amiable
and love-like than usual to-day. It’s cooler up
here, too. Now pass over those chocolates, Bess.”
</p>
<p>
“And watch her get more and more—well, I’ll
say plump—before your eyes, like that fat boy
Scott tells about,” laughed Belle.
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t Scott’s fat boy. He was in Dickens,”
corrected Cora. “Nicholas Nickleby, I think.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
“Pickwick Papers!” voiced Bess. “There! I
know something even if I am—plump. But, girls,
I have lost five pounds in the last month.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so’s you’d notice it,” murmured Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Cease! Cease and have done!” admonished
Cora. “How does that new one go—two slow
and one quick to the side and then——”
</p>
<p>
“Not slow at all!” interrupted Bess. “You’ve
got to follow through or you’ll slice the ball
and——”
</p>
<p>
“What in the world are you talking about?”
demanded Cora, her eyes opening wide. “Slice
the ball? What’s that in? The fox trot?”
</p>
<p>
“I was speaking of golf,” murmured Bess.
</p>
<p>
“She’s taken it up to—reduce,” whispered Belle.
</p>
<p>
“I thought you meant that new three-step we
tried the other night,” came from Cora.
</p>
<p>
“It’s too warm even to talk about dancing,”
declared Belle. “Really we must think of getting
away sooner. Do you think we could get that bungalow
at Camp Surprise earlier than we had
planned to take it, Cora?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. Mother made all the arrangements.
But I can find out. Do you really think
you’d like to go sooner?”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly do,” murmured plump Bess, who
seemed to feel the sudden summer heat more than
did Cora, or the more svelt Belle. “Oh, by the
way, Cora! why do they call it Camp Surprise?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
“I meant to ask that, too,” added Belle. “It’s
such an odd name.”
</p>
<p>
“And there’s an odd story connected with it,”
said Cora. “I’ll have to ask mother about it.
She merely mentioned it, and something else came
up so I forgot to get the particulars. I’ll find out
when we go back. But if you girls are really in
earnest about starting our summer vacation a little
earlier this year——”
</p>
<p>
“I most certainly am in earnest,” Bess said.
</p>
<p>
“And I,” added her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll see what we can do,” went on the girl
at the wheel. “Oh dear! I wish I hadn’t eaten
those chocolates!” she exclaimed, making a wry
face. “I ought to have known better. Candy always
makes me thirsty, and I didn’t bring the
vacuum bottle.”
</p>
<p>
Belle sat up, carefully removed, with the tip of
her tongue, some brown chocolate stains from the
tips of her pink, well-manicured fingers and, looking
up and down the road, announced:
</p>
<p>
“That dear little tea room—Ye Olde Spinning
Wheel—is only about a mile farther on. Suppose
we go there? I’m dying for a cup of tea with
lemon in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, so am I!” added Bess. “They say lemon
is thinning.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you’d better have lemonade with a leaf
or two of tea in it,” said Belle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
</p>
<p>
“You—you——” spluttered Bess, drawing back
her hand in which nestled a chocolate. And then
her desire to throw it was overcome by her appetite
for the confection.
</p>
<p>
“Ye Olde Spinning Wheel,” repeated Cora.
“That sounds most enticing. We’ll go there, if
only to keep you two from bickering. What’s
gotten in you sisters to-day, I never saw you so on
each other’s nerves.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the weather,” returned Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope so. Well, if you’ve admired the
view enough we’ll go on.”
</p>
<p>
They had come to a pause at the crest of a
shaded hill, and down below them lay the village
in which the three girls lived. Cheerful Chelton it
had been designated, and cheerful it was.
</p>
<p>
Cora, who had not stopped the engine, slipped
the clutch in after shifting the gear and the car
moved down the slope, gradually cutting off the
view of the town.
</p>
<p>
“What about the boys?” asked Bess, apropos
of nothing in particular.
</p>
<p>
“What boys?” demanded Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Ours, of course,” and Bess looked surprised
that any others should have been thought of. “I
mean your brother Jack, Walter Pennington and
Paul Hastings. Didn’t you say Paul was thinking
of going to camp with our boys, if they took the
little bungalow near ours at Camp Surprise?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Paul is coming,” Cora said.
</p>
<p>
“Well, can the boys get away earlier if we do?
It won’t be any fun going there alone, particularly
if there’s a mystery about the place.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t say there was any mystery about the
place,” corrected Cora. “Though there may be.
Besides, we’re to have a chaperon, you know. Or
at least the caretaker and his wife live in Camp
Surprise, and I presume she will be a chaperon.”
</p>
<p>
“But it won’t be half the fun if the boys don’t
come along,” declared Belle. “They are so jolly,
and—er—well, you know what I mean,” she
finished a bit lamely.
</p>
<p>
“No need to explain at all,” said Cora cheerfully.
“It’s perfectly all right. If I go, that means
mother can close the house so much earlier. Jack
won’t stay there alone, I know, so he’s likely to
tag along.”
</p>
<p>
“And if Jack goes Walter will. I guess we can
count of making an earlier start on our vacation
than we contemplated,” said Bess. “It will be
lovely.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Cora assented.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the tea room,” added Belle a little later
as the car came out on a long, level stretch of
road. “It’s a perfect dear of a place; isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“A regular gazelle,” agreed Cora mockingly.
</p>
<p>
She swung her machine into the parking place
provided, and a few minutes afterward the three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
girls were sitting at one of the wicker tables, in
wicker chairs, near a window which opened on a
vine-shaded porch, while electric fans hummed and
droned breezily and refreshingly behind them and
in front of them stood rose-tinted plates heaped
high with pale yellow cream, nestled alongside of
which were delicately browned macaroons.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a symphony of color!” murmured
Cora, as the white-capped, colored waitress set the
refreshments from off her mahogany-cretonne tray.
</p>
<p>
“If it tastes half as good as it looks,” murmured
Bess, “I’m going to have another plate, if I have
to roll twice my usual number of times before I go
to bed to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“It is good,” said Belle. “It’s delicious!”
</p>
<p>
“I could just sit here and—dream,” announced
Belle, as she closed her “effective” eyes, as Jack
Kimball had designated them.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is very soothing and restful,” agreed
her sister, who had been rendered sleepy by the
combination of heat, a refreshing meal and the
droning of the electric fans.
</p>
<p>
“I feel sleepy myself,” Cora confessed, closing
her eyes.
</p>
<p>
She opened them a moment later though, for a
cry from Belle brought her and Bess to a most
unpleasant awakening.
</p>
<p>
“Your car, Cora!” cried the slim Robinson twin.
“Some one is taking your auto!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—THE LOST TRAIL</h2>
<p>
“My car! Some one taking my car!” repeated
Cora Kimball. “Who is it, Belle?” and she hurried
to the window from which the tall, willowy
Robinson twin was gazing toward the spot where
the auto had been left.
</p>
<p>
“Two young men. I saw them get in, and—there
they go! Out into the road! We must stop
them!”
</p>
<p>
Belle turned to make her exit, but her dress
caught on a chair, and as Cora and Bess were
behind her, they, too, were delayed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hurry!” begged Cora.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tear my dress,” retorted Belle.
</p>
<p>
With a pull she loosed it from a splinter of the
wicker chair, and then made for the doorway, followed
by the other girls.
</p>
<p>
And while they are thus on their way to intercept
those who had taken Cora’s car I will devote
a few minutes to acquainting my new readers with
the characters and incidents that go to make the
previous volumes of this series.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“The Motor Girls,” was the title of the initial
book. In that we find Cora Kimball, the daughter
of a wealthy widow, with her brother Jack, living
in “Cheerful Chelton,” as it has been called, a village
on the Chelton river, in New England, not far
from the New York boundary. Cora and Jack
each had an automobile, but most of the adventures
took place in or about Cora’s car, in which
she and her two most intimate chums, the Robinson
twins—Bess and Belle—went for many a ride.
</p>
<p>
The Robinson girls were the daughters of Mr.
and Mrs. Perry Robinson, the former a rich railroad
man, and I think I have already sufficiently
indicated to you their characters. Bess was plump,
and Belle tall and willowy, inclined to indolence
which she imagined was graceful. Cora Kimball
was a leader, and where she went the Robinson
twins generally followed.
</p>
<p>
Jack Kimball, a student at Exmouth college, was
almost as much a chum of Cora’s as were her girl
friends, and the girls regarded Jack and his chums,
Walter Pennington and Paul Hastings, as their especial
retainers and vassals as the case demanded.
Paul’s sister Hazel, a sweet girl—if you know
what I mean—had been quite friendly with Cora
and her chums, until her removal to another city.
Hazel was expected for a visit to Cora soon, and,
as has been mentioned, Paul contemplated going
camping with the boys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
</p>
<p>
Soon after Cora secured her car the Robinson
twins induced their father to purchase one. The
Motor Girls, as they had come to be known, went
on a tour, in the course of which many things happened.
They had more adventures at Lookout
Beach, and also when they went through New England.
</p>
<p>
In succession Cora and her friends paid a visit
to Cedar Lake, down on the coast, and next they
spent a summer on Crystal Bay. They had there
a most delightful time, but perhaps not more so
than that told of in the book immediately preceding
this one.
</p>
<p>
That volume is named “The Motor Girls on
Waters Blue.” I forgot to mention that the girls,
after having served their apprenticeship, as it
were, in automobiles, had acquired a fine, large motor
boat. In this they had many good times,
though it was not this boat that figured largely on
the blue waters. When Mr. Robinson had been
called to Porto Rico on business he had taken his
daughters and Cora with him.
</p>
<p>
How the steamer on which Mr. Robinson sailed
to another island was endangered, how the <em>Tartar</em>
was chartered by Cora and her chums to look for
the shipwrecked ones, and how Inez Ralcanto, the
beautiful Spanish girl, and her father, a political
refugee, were aided—all this is set down in the
book preceding this present volume.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
It was not until after many hardships and not a
little anxiety that matters were finally straightened
out, and our friends came back to Cheerful Chelton,
which had never seemed so homelike or so desirable,
Cora said, as after the exciting episodes in
what was practically a foreign land.
</p>
<p>
A fall and winter of gaiety had brought spring
and early summer, in which delightful time of the
year we now find our girl friends once more.
</p>
<p>
“It is gone! My car is gone!” exclaimed Cora,
as they ran out of the tea room.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it is!” declared Belle. “Didn’t I see
them take it!”
</p>
<p>
“Two young men, you say?” asked her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I didn’t see their faces, but I knew they
were young by the way they moved about—so
lively!”
</p>
<p>
“Say!” cried Cora, imbued by a sudden idea.
“Could they have been Jack and Walter?”
</p>
<p>
“Your brother?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I heard him say he was coming over in
this direction in his car. He and Walter might
have driven up, and, seeing my car and guessing
that we were inside, may have gone off in it just
for a joke.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s <em>possible</em>,” assented Belle. “Anything is
possible for Jack and Wally. But if they came
here they must have left their car near by. Turn
about is fair play—let’s annex theirs.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“Let’s find it first,” said Cora.
</p>
<p>
They hurried out to the road. A quick look up
and down showed no automobile in sight—not
even Cora’s.
</p>
<p>
“They must have speeded up,” murmured Belle.
“Oh! why weren’t we quicker?”
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t amount to anything if those young
men were really Jack and Walter,” Cora said.
“But we can’t be sure of that; can we, Belle?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I can’t. I only had a glimpse of their
backs, and all backs look alike to me.”
</p>
<p>
“It can’t have been Jack,” declared Bess, “or
his car would be somewhere in sight. He wouldn’t
know we were in the tea room until he came up
close, and then there wouldn’t have been time to
run his car back.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t tell what they would do,” said Cora.
“Come on, we’ll walk as far as the turn in the
road, and see what’s down there.”
</p>
<p>
“Hadn’t you better report your loss to the proprietor
of the tea room?” suggested Belle. “He
might send a man out to look for the machine.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to make too much fuss if it was
Jack and Walter,” Cora objected. “Let’s take a
look ourselves first.”
</p>
<p>
The girls hurried down the road, all their drowsiness
gone now. They were rather alarmed in
spite of the cool way in which Cora took it.
</p>
<p>
“It’s dreadfully warm walking,” complained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
Bess. “I shall have to have more cream after this
is over.”
</p>
<p>
“You can go back and wait for us,” suggested
Cora, “if you’re too——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t dare say I’m too stout to keep on the
trail!” cried Bess. “I’ll never give up!”
</p>
<p>
They were almost at the turn when the honking
of an automobile horn warned them of the approach
of a car.
</p>
<p>
“There they come back!” cried Belle, in relieved
tones.
</p>
<p>
But a moment later, as a machine swung into
view around the curve, the girls saw that it was
not Cora’s.
</p>
<p>
“But it’s Jack and Walter!” cried the former’s
sister. “Wait! Stop!” she begged. “Jack—Wally—we’re
in trouble! Did you take our car?”
</p>
<p>
“Take your car?” repeated Jack, bringing his
machine to a stop with a screeching of brakes.
“What’s the joke?”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t a joke at all!” declared Belle. “I saw
two young men making off with Cora’s car. At
first we thought it might be you and Wally.”
</p>
<p>
“Not guilty!” affirmed the latter, holding up a
protesting hand.
</p>
<p>
“Where did all this happen?” Jack wanted to
know.
</p>
<p>
“At the Spinning Wheel tea room. We stopped
there,” his sister informed him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“Which way did they go?” asked Walter Pennington.
</p>
<p>
“Down this way,” Belle said, explaining what
she had seen, and how they had come along the
road thinking to meet the perpetrators of the joke.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Wally!” cried Jack. “We’ll get after
those fellows. It may have been a joke, and,
again, it may not. No use taking any chances.
There have been several cars stolen around here
lately. Maybe there’s a regular organized gang.
Go on back to your tea and cakes, girls. We’ll
round up the villains. Ha! Ha!” and he struck a
theatrical attitude.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll wait at the tea room for you,” Cora
said. “You can trace my car in the dust, Jack,
by the tire-marks. There’s a big patch, where it
was vulcanized. It’s on the right forward wheel,
and it makes a mark like a big Z. Look for it.”
</p>
<p>
“I will, Sis. But there isn’t much chance. Too
many cars pass along this road to let the dust-marks
of any particular one stay in sight long.
But we’ll do the best we can.”
</p>
<p>
Jack backed and turned his car around, and was
soon off down the road in a clatter of exhausts,
while the three girls went back to Ye Olde Spinning
Wheel.
</p>
<p>
“Who do you suppose they could be—those two
fellows?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Haven’t the least idea,” her sister assured her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“It couldn’t have been Paul Hastings, could it?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not!” declared Cora. “Paul isn’t
given to playing such jokes. Besides, he’s in the
auto business you know, and he doesn’t believe in
taking chances with the cars of others. It may be
a joke, as Jack says, and some of our numerous
friends may have tried to scare us, or it may
be——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say your lovely car is really <em>stolen</em>!” interrupted
Bess, impulsively.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’d have to say it if it were,” declared
the practical Cora. “And the sooner we find out
the better, in order to get the police after the
thieves.”
</p>
<p>
Wearily they trudged back to the tea room,
which they had left so suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s have some more ice cream while we’re
waiting,” suggested Bess.
</p>
<p>
They had nearly finished their second plates
when the honking of a horn warned them of the
approach of some one. Eagerly they looked out
to see Jack and Walter returning.
</p>
<p>
“We lost the trail!” Jack called. “I saw the
tire marks, Cora, for a little way, then they disappeared.
We’ll have to notify the police. Your
car’s stolen all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Jack!”
</p>
<p>
“Might as well realize it first as last, Sis!
Where’s a telephone?” he asked the waitress.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—TWO STRANGE MEN</h2>
<p>
“What are you going to do, Jack?” asked
Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Notify the Chelton police, and also the authorities
here. They will send out a general alarm
better than we can. Now who saw these chaps,
and how did they look?”
</p>
<p>
“Belle saw them.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, Belle, I’ll have to call on your detective
abilities. Describe these villainous characters.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t call them particularly villainous
looking,” said the tall girl. “In fact we thought
for a time it was you two, and——”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” interrupted Walter. “Belle, I thank
you for your good opinion.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on, get down to business!” exclaimed
Jack Kimball. “I want to know how these fellows
looked so I can tell the police. Were they young
or old?”
</p>
<p>
“Two young men,” answered Belle. “They
were about your age, Jack.”
</p>
<p>
“But, unfortunately, they did not have his angelic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
disposition,” mocked Walter. “Bouquets are
coming your way fast, Jack.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll dispense with them. Come on now, Belle.
Anything else except that they were young?”
</p>
<p>
Belle thought for a moment. She had had such
a momentary glimpse of the two that, really, it
was hard to describe them adequately for the purposes
of police detection.
</p>
<p>
“Why not describe the car?” asked Cora. “No
matter who is in my machine they haven’t a right
to it, and they should be arrested on sight.”
</p>
<p>
“Good idea!” agreed Jack. “I can describe the
car right enough.”
</p>
<p>
“And give the license numbers,” said Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Of course. Good girl. Let me have them,
Cora.”
</p>
<p>
They were the only ones in the tea room at this
time, and the excitement was only communicated
to the help. The waitress showed Jack where the
telephone booth was, and while Cora, Walter and
the girls explained to the girl cashier at the desk
what had happened, Jack got the Chelton police
over the telephone and asked them to send out an
alarm, and also to be on the lookout for the
thieves.
</p>
<p>
The tea room was in Pepack, the township next
to Chelton, and Jack also called up the town hall
and notified the authorities there, who promised
to do what they could.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“But they may have taken any of half a dozen
roads leading out of here,” Walter said. “They
must have hurried away.”
</p>
<p>
“And you didn’t have a glimpse of them?”
asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Not a trace,” answered Jack. “We managed
to pick up the trail by means of that patch on the
tire. Saw it in the dust several times. Then it
was lost in the shuffle, as you might say, so we
thought it better to come back. I wonder if the
people here noticed anything of two strange men
hanging about.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll ask the cashier,” suggested Cora.
</p>
<p>
She knew, slightly, the girl who sat at the cash
register, for Ye Olde Spinning Wheel was a popular
resort for automobile parties.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Miss Kimball,” the girl said, “there were
two young men in here this morning, though
whether they were the ones who took your car I
can’t say.”
</p>
<p>
“How did they look?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know that I can tell you. They
were both of medium height, and were smooth
shaven—I mean they had no beards or moustaches,
though both of them would have been better for a
visit to the barber’s.”
</p>
<p>
“What did they do or say?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“They came in and each had a plate of cream,”
went on the girl. “I didn’t exactly like their looks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
for, though we try to run a place that will suit
every one, we are a bit particular too. But they
didn’t make any fuss, and even tipped the waitress.”
</p>
<p>
“Then they must be ‘regular fellows,’” said
Walter, jokingly.
</p>
<p>
“‘Scuse me,” broke in the voice of the waitress—the
same one who had waited on the girls—“but
de dime tip dey gibbed me wasn’t any good.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“It was plugged. Look!” and she exhibited it.
</p>
<p>
“So it is!” exclaimed Cora’s brother. “They
weren’t so regular after all.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t see it till after dey’d gone,” the negress
went on.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you can describe them for me,” Jack
suggested.
</p>
<p>
It developed that the waitress could give a better
word-picture of the two young men than could
the cashier, whose attention, naturally, was taken
up with her duties at the desk.
</p>
<p>
Jack noted down the none too good distinguishing
marks as described by the waitress, and went
to telephone them to the police as an additional
help in capturing those who had gone with Cora’s
car.
</p>
<p>
There was nothing more that could be done just
then, and Jack was about to suggest that, by means
of a little crowding, he could take his sister and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
her chums back to Chelton in his car when the
young woman who had charge of the tea room
entered, it being her hour to go on duty.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” she asked, as she observed
the group of excited young people about
the cashier’s desk.
</p>
<p>
“Two strange young men went off with Miss
Kimball’s auto,” was the cashier’s answer, and the
circumstances were related.
</p>
<p>
“Two young men!” exclaimed the manager.
“Why I remember those two who had cream in
here this morning. They spoke to me as they came
out on the porch, and I bought tickets of them.”
</p>
<p>
“Tickets!” exclaimed Jack. “Tickets?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. They seemed all right—I mean respectful
and all that. They said they had unexpectedly
run out of funds and wanted to know if I wouldn’t
buy some railroad tickets they had to New York.
I said I hadn’t any use for them, and couldn’t get
off to go to New York anyhow, as this was our
busy season.”
</p>
<p>
“So you didn’t buy them?” asked Cora. “But
I thought you said——”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t buy the railroad tickets,” said the
young lady manager. “But I did purchase two
tickets for the opera performance that is to be
given at Chelton on Friday night. I’d been wanting
to go, and I was going to telephone for tickets
when these young men said they had two good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
ones they’d let me have for less than the regular
price.”
</p>
<p>
“And you took them?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It seemed a bargain, and I am desirous
to see the play.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mind letting me see the tickets?” asked
Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly you may see them,” was the answer,
and from her pocketbook, which she had left in
charge of the cashier, the manager took out two
slips of blue pasteboard.
</p>
<p>
“Hum! They seem regular all right,”
remarked Jack. “Date and seat numbers all proper.
I know where those seats are, too, right in the
middle of the first row balcony. I always sit there
myself when I go.”
</p>
<p>
“They said they were good seats,” declared the
girl, “and I saved a dollar. They wanted the
money they said, for they had spent their last for
some ice cream. They seemed to be all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe they were,” agreed Jack. “Of course
it’s perfectly proper for persons who can’t use
railroad or theatre tickets they have purchased, to sell
them again. And these tickets seem to be the
same as those you would get at the box office. And
there’s no crime in being without cash. But it is a
crime to take an automobile.”
</p>
<p>
“The only question is whether the same two fellows
are involved,” suggested Walter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s it,” agreed Jack. “I wish you girls
had had a better look at those who went off in the
machine.”
</p>
<p>
“It all happened so suddenly,” Belle explained.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, such things generally do,” remarked Cora.
“Well, there’s nothing else to do, is there?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess not,” said Jack, who had telephoned
in the additional description of the young men who
had sold the tickets, adding the information that
there was only a suspicion that they were the same
two who were responsible for the taking of the car.
</p>
<p>
“If they had only kept the theatre tickets, instead
of selling them,” said Walter, “we’d have
a good chance of arresting them.”
</p>
<p>
“How?” Belle demanded.
</p>
<p>
“By watching those two seats. As soon as the
fellows came in to take their places we could have
an officer arrest them.”
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t try it on me,” begged the young
lady who had purchased the coupons. “I don’t
want a scene,” and she regarded Walter smilingly.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” agreed Cora. “Oh, dear! My
nice car, that I was counting on taking to Camp
Surprise with me.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get it back before then!” declared Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! but we’re going earlier than we planned
originally,” said Belle.
</p>
<p>
“And she wants you boys to come, too!” cried
Bess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
“No more than you do!” snapped Belle, her
fair face flushing.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the idea?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“It’s getting so unbearably warm,” said Cora,
and then she explained that they might go earlier
than originally planned to the bungalow camp in
the mountains.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we might manage it,” Jack said. “We’ll
talk it over, Wally. Have to see Paul, though I
guess he’d fit in anywhere Bess went.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! is that so?” cried the plump girl, blushing
in her turn.
</p>
<p>
The tea room people promised to be on the
lookout for the strange young men, and to notify
Jack or the police if they came around again.
</p>
<p>
“But if they were the ones who took the car
they won’t come back,” Walter declared.
</p>
<p>
By crowding, all the young people managed to
get in Jack’s car. On the way back to Chelton a
sharp lookout was kept for the missing machine,
but no trace of it was seen, and Cora was much
depressed when she reached home.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” whispered Jack, “you may use
mine, Sis, until yours shows up. Don’t worry,
we’ll get it yet.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” murmured Cora.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—A CURIOUS STORY</h2>
<p>
Such measures as one might expect to have
taken in a place like Chelton and the surrounding
towns were taken by the authorities in an endeavor
to recover Cora’s stolen automobile. For stolen
it certainly was, and not taken in a joke. That
fact was patent when several days passed and no
trace of it was found and no word received as to
where it might have been taken or abandoned by
the two strange young men.
</p>
<p>
“They might merely have taken it to get some
place, seeing that they had no money,” observed
Belle, when the three girls were talking the matter
over one day at Cora’s house.
</p>
<p>
“They had railroad tickets, though,” said Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but to New York, and perhaps they didn’t
want to go there.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think New York would be just the
place where they would want to go if they had no
money,” came from Cora. “There are so many
chances to make money there.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps they didn’t dare go,” suggested Belle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” came in a duet from the
others.
</p>
<p>
“They might have done something—perhaps
have taken another auto—and they knew the police
would be after them,” explained Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Quite dramatic,” observed Cora. “But whoever
they are or whatever their motive, I wish
they’d send back my car. I want it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t blame you a bit,” came from Bess.
“Come on, we’ll go out on another searching tour.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed Cora, and they were soon
on the road again in the car of the Robinson
twins. The girls had not left it all to the authorities
to find the missing automobile. They had
made diligent inquiries themselves on all roads
leading out of Chelton and in the vicinity of the
tea room. Nor had the boys been idle. Paul
Hastings arrived in town on business connected
with the automobile concern by which he was employed,
and he, Jack and Walter, made it their
business to scurry around in Jack’s car, looking
for clews.
</p>
<p>
But the slender ones they found proved unavailing.
Automobiles are all too common to attract
attention unless there is something unusual about
them. And Cora’s car, while it was a fine one,
was not unusual enough to call for special notice.
</p>
<p>
The number on the license plates had been given
to the police and constables, but it would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
been a comparatively easy matter for the thieves
to change the number or rub oil on and let dust
accumulate until it would have been all but indecipherable.
Then, too, persons seldom notice the
number on a car unless there has been some accident.
</p>
<p>
“It just seems to have disappeared,” declared
Cora at the close of the day, when a long tour and
many inquiries had resulted in nothing. “I just
wish I had hold of those two fellows!”
</p>
<p>
“It <em>is</em> provoking,” agreed Belle. “Let’s stop at
the tea room and see if they’ve heard anything
more there.”
</p>
<p>
The girl at the cash register, the young lady
manager, and the colored maid who had waited on
them before greeted the three pretty chums smilingly
as they again entered the pleasant tea room
of Ye Olde Spinning Wheel.
</p>
<p>
“Were your tickets for the play all right?”
asked Cora as the manager stepped over to inquire
if everything was to their liking.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t used them yet. They are for this
week Friday. Oh! I’m sure they’re all right. Some
of my friends bought tickets from the same fellows
for the same night and they are next mine.”
</p>
<p>
“Those chaps must have planned for a regular
theatre party,” observed Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Have you had any trace of your car yet?” the
cashier asked, as Cora went up to pay the check.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m sorry to say, I haven’t.”
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t get it soon, Cora,” said Belle,
“you’d better plan to use ours to go to Camp Surprise.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’re going in the motor boat,” Cora said.
“I didn’t tell you, but mother learned that the
roads around the camp were so rough that it would
certainly spoil a car to take it to camp, so I
wouldn’t take mine, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“Camp Surprise,” repeated the pretty cashier.
“That sounds interesting.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope we don’t find it too much so,” returned
Belle.
</p>
<p>
The plans for going to live at the bungalow with
the odd name, which was situated in the mountains
some miles west of Chelton, had been talked over
at length, and an earlier trip than the one originally
decided on had been voted for.
</p>
<p>
“Going in the motor boat! How nice!” cried
Bess, as they went out of the tea room. “Then it
doesn’t matter about your auto, Cora—I mean, of
course—oh! I don’t mean that!” she cried, blushing.
“Of course you want it back——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I should say I do!” exclaimed Jack’s
sister with mock indignation.
</p>
<p>
“I mean we won’t have to wait until you get
your car back before going to Camp Surprise,”
Bess went on.
</p>
<p>
“No,” agreed Cora. “That won’t delay us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p>
“And now don’t you think you ought to tell us
why the camp where we are going to spend most
of the summer has such an odd name?” asked
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been meaning to this long while,” assented
Cora, “but so many things have happened that I
didn’t get to it. Come on, let’s sit out here on the
porch, where it’s so nice, cool and shady, and I’ll
tell you all I know.”
</p>
<p>
“You couldn’t, Cora, dear—not in the limited
time at our disposal,” said Belle, languidly sinking
into an easy wicker chair. “You know too much.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you. I believe this was my treat, so now
we’re even. But I meant all I know about Camp
Surprise.”
</p>
<p>
“First, how did it get its name?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Because of the surprising things that happen
there.”
</p>
<p>
“Happen—happen?” queried Belle. “Do you
mean they still happen?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, so mother said,” observed Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Bur-r-r!” shivered Bess, with a hasty glance
over her shoulder. “I’m not so sure I want to go
there.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” cried Cora. “If there’s a ghost
we’ll lay it—whatever that means.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Cora! Ghosts!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I don’t mean that, exactly. It isn’t so
bad as that. The worst things that have happened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
are that things in the bungalow seem to be upset
and misplaced without reason.”
</p>
<p>
“Upset? Misplaced?” murmured Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Without reason?” added her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! perhaps I am making a mountain out of a
molehill,” confessed Cora. “This is how the matter
stands. Up in the mountains are a number of
camps, cottages, bungalows—what you like—which
belong to a development company. The
bungalows and camps are rented, furnished, to
whoever wants them. Camp Surprise, where we
shall have a good-sized bungalow to live in, is one
of the best of these resorts. It is about five miles
in from the Towanda river, which is what the
Chelton is called up state, and it was going up the
river that I planned to use the motor boat.”
</p>
<p>
“How do we get over the five miles?” asked
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“By buckboards over a mountain road. That’s
why we won’t need the autos. Of course we could
use a car, but as long as mine is still among the
missing we won’t make any such plans. Camp
Surprise is right on the edge of a stream which is
quiet enough in dry weather, but a torrent when
there’s a heavy rain. And there’s a little lake and
a waterfall near the bungalow.”
</p>
<p>
“That sounds lovely,” remarked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“It is lovely,” asserted Cora. “I’ve seen pictures
of it. And while our bungalow is on one side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
of the mountain torrent there is another one, not
far off, on the other side, where the boys are going
to stay.”
</p>
<p>
“How nice,” commented Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Is that other bungalow within sight or calling
distance of ours?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“One or the other, yes,” assented Cora. “But
why so anxious?”
</p>
<p>
“Because when those ghosts, or whatever they
are, get to moving things about I want a man, or at
least a good-sized boy around,” was the answer.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” exclaimed Cora. “It isn’t so bad
as that.”
</p>
<p>
“Say it again,” begged Bess. “You told about
unseen hands moving chairs and tables.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t mean it exactly that way,” and Cora
smiled. “You see there is a man and his wife who
have rooms in the bungalow, Mr. and Mrs.
Floyd. They look after the place, and they’ll be
our chaperons. I did think mother might be able
to go with us, but she won’t. But mother knows
Mrs. Floyd, and says she’s very nice.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope the ghosts will be nice,” said Belle.
</p>
<p>
Cora laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you funny girl! Why will you persist in
calling them ghosts?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, aren’t they? Moving chairs about?”
</p>
<p>
“Is that what happened—or happens?” asked
Bess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
“So I understand,” returned Cora. “Mr. and
Mrs. Floyd don’t use the main bungalow, keeping
to their own rooms. But they wrote mother that,
of late, there have been some queer goings on.
They said they would go out, leaving the rooms in
perfect order, only to find them all upset on their
return. Chairs would be misplaced, tables that
had been in the middle of the room would be
shoved back against the wall. Dishes would be
taken out of the closets, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Tramps!” interrupted Belle.
</p>
<p>
“What?” cried Cora, rather startled by the suddenness
of the ejaculation.
</p>
<p>
“I mean tramps got in and did it.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t think so,” and Cora spoke slowly.
“For, though the dishes were taken from the pantry,
there was no food missing. Tramps would
take food.”
</p>
<p>
“Is this all that happened?” Bess demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Well, once something was taken,” Cora said.
“A party had the bungalow, and when they left
at the end of their stay, they forgot to take some
of their silver with them. Then came one of the
upsetting periods, and the furniture was misplaced
and the silver taken.”
</p>
<p>
Belle and Bess looked at their chum, then the
former said slowly:
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t believe we want to go to Camp
Surprise, Cora.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—COUNTERFEIT TICKETS</h2>
<p>
Cora laughed melodiously. Belle and Bess
looked at her with just a shade of indignation in
their eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t think you’d be such—such, well, I
won’t say cowards,” Cora voiced, when the gale
of merriment had passed. “But I think, Belle,
that you would rise above the occasion, even if
Bess——”
</p>
<p>
“Now what is there she can do that I can’t?”
demanded the plump twin truculently. “I guess if
it’s a question of bravery, I’m as willing as she is
to go to Camp Surprise.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought you’d be,” Cora observed.
</p>
<p>
“But is it a question of bravery?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“What else?” her sister demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Well, from the way in which Cora told it, I
should think it would need some members of the
Society for Psychic Research to get to the bottom
of all those queer manifestations. Cora Kimball!”
Belle suddenly exclaimed, sitting up in her chair.
“You haven’t been hoaxing us; have you? This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
isn’t a joke; is it? I mean all those things really
did happen; didn’t they?”
</p>
<p>
“My! what a lot of questions to set off at
once,” objected Cora. “But I can answer them all
by saying that I have given the story to you just as
it came to me. As far as I know, it’s no joke, and
the way the furniture behaved, or rather, was
made to act, is strictly true.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are still going to Camp Surprise?”
asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly. Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“Well—er—that is—— Oh! of course I know
there’s no such thing as a ghost,” said Belle. “But,
at the same time, even if those things happened by
human agencies—as naturally they did—it might
make it very unpleasant for us up there.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” cried Cora. “It will make it all
the more interesting. Think of the fun we can
have, organizing ghost-detecting parties, sitting up
until all hours of the night, daring the boys to sit
with us. And then, after all, finding out it is only
the tricks of some alleged fun-loving person, or
perhaps boys of the neighborhood.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you really think so, Cora?” Belle asked.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” murmured Bess, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Come! Where has all the bravery of the Motor
Girls vanished to?” demanded Cora with a silvery
laugh. “We didn’t act thus timidly when we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
solved the secret of the red oar on Crystal Bay.
And perhaps——”
</p>
<p>
“Cora’s right!” interrupted Belle.
</p>
<p>
“She generally is,” contributed Bess.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a secret here, and we will solve it!”
her sister went on. “I didn’t look at it that way
before, but I see it now. We mustn’t be driven
away, or kept from going just because of these
rumors. We’ll go to Camp Surprise and surprise
those who are making such a fuss there. I wonder
some one hasn’t done it long ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Just what I was about to remark,” came from
Cora. “I’m glad to see that your natural courage
has come back. I thought it would. We
haven’t been together on various quests for nothing.
Now we’ll prove ourselves true Motor Girls,
and get at the bottom of these surprising happenings.
You won’t back out?”
</p>
<p>
“Never!” affirmed Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Cross my heart!” laughed her sister, with the
old, familiar, childish gesture of emphasizing a
statement.
</p>
<p>
“Then it’s all settled. Now let’s go home.
Jack and Walter said they were going over to
Meadport to-day to see if any word had been received
there of my missing auto. They may have
returned with some news.”
</p>
<p>
“Why was Meadport regarded so favorably?”
asked Bess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, a constable there sent word to our police
that there had been a number of petty robberies
committed in the neighborhood. A number of
thefts would take place in one night, and so far
apart that the only probable theory was that the
thieves used an auto. Jack thought my dear car
might be used for such base purposes, so he and
Wally went over there to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope they have good news,” said Belle,
as with her sister and Cora she entered the Robinson
automobile and headed back for Cheerful
Chelton.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing doing,” announced Jack, as his sister
and her chums came in sight of the Kimball home,
and saw him with Walter, sitting on the broad,
shady piazza. “Absolutely nothing transpiring, as
the poet saith.”
</p>
<p>
“College hasn’t improved your slang any,” observed
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“No, I guess I’ll have to take a P. G. course to
accomplish that. I am a bit rusty. Wally, suppose
you give them a sample.”
</p>
<p>
“Spare us,” murmured Cora. “Was there really
no news, Jack?”
</p>
<p>
“Not an atom, or even a molecule. Which is
smaller, Wally? I forget.”
</p>
<p>
“Same here. Anyhow they hadn’t caught those
Meadport thieves, so whether they have your auto
or not, Cora, my dear, remains yet to be proved.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
The young people talked on, the conversation
reverting naturally to Camp Surprise.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think it all means, Jack?” asked
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Kids playing tricks,” declared Jack tersely.
“So it didn’t scare you girls out from going?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not!” declared Bess indignantly. A
look passed from her to Cora, from Cora to Belle—and
that was all.
</p>
<p>
“That’s right!” chimed in Walter. “Don’t let
a little thing like that scare you away. We’ll get
at the bottom of this mystery.”
</p>
<p>
“When do you plan to go?” asked Cora of her
brother.
</p>
<p>
“As soon as Wally can get his new suit that he’s
ordered from that nobby tailor.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you believe him,” cried Walter, thumping
his chum on the back. “I’m as ready as he is.
He’s waiting for one of those sport shirts——”
</p>
<p>
“Go on! I wouldn’t wear one!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, make up your minds, and we’ll all go together,”
urged Cora. “We can go up in the motor
boat as far as possible, and take buckboards the
rest of the way. We’d like to have you boys on
hand when we begin the investigation of Camp
Surprise.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ho! Afraid?” laughed Walter. “I
thought there was a mouse in the woodpile somewhere,
Jack, my boy!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nothing of the sort!” came from Cora. “Besides,
you’re thinking of the mouse and the lion.
It is an African gentleman of color who makes
the woodpile his habitation.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” admitted Walter. “I never was
very good at dates anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“Fig paste is more to your liking. Have a chocolate,”
urged Bess.
</p>
<p>
“We want you along to bear testimony when we
have routed out the mischief-makers,” said Cora,
after the laughter had subsided. “Your bungalow
is near ours, and we can call to you to come and
hold the disturbers when we capture them.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that what you’re going to do?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” returned Belle, as if the girls had
never hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it would be a pity to disappoint you,”
Walter declared. “We’ll go when they do, Jack.
But—whisper—they’ll be more than a week yet. I
know girls.”
</p>
<p>
“You only <em>think</em> you do,” mocked Cora. “We’ll
be ready before you are.”
</p>
<p>
Then they began to talk seriously and plan for
their summer outing. It was not the first time they
had been away together, the boys and girls often
going to the same resort and occupying adjacent
bungalows or cottages. In this way they divided
such work as there was, and multiplied the possible
good times.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kimball was to go to the Thousand Islands
with her sister, which left Jack and Cora
free to do as they pleased. Mr. and Mrs. Robinson
would, as usual, occupy their seashore cottage,
but Bess and Belle would not join them
there until later in the season, going first to Camp
Surprise with Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now it’s all settled,” declared Cora, after
a season of talk. “We’ll go to Camp Surprise
two weeks from to-day. I’ll tell mother, and have
her write to Mrs. Floyd to have everything in readiness.”
</p>
<p>
“Even the ghosts?” demanded Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Even the ghosts,” agreed Cora, accepting the
implied challenge.
</p>
<p>
“Good!” cried Jack.
</p>
<p>
A few days after this the three girls, all of whom
belonged to a church home mission society, went
to take some medicine and food to an old woman
who was one that the society looked after. This
dependent lived some distance out of Cheerful
Chelton, and the Robinson twins brought their car
in which to carry the baskets of food.
</p>
<p>
They had done their little errand of mercy and
on the way back Cora proposed that they stop at
Ye Olde Spinning Wheel for some tea or ice cream,
as the girls preferred.
</p>
<p>
They had the place practically to themselves, as
it was not the hour when most motorists stopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
for refreshments. Cora and her chums spoke to
the manager, and noticed that she seemed a bit
downcast.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” asked Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s something that happened last night.
You know I told you I had two tickets for the
opera. My friend gave me the money to get them,
and I bought them off the two young fellows who
were here one day last week.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it was the time my auto was taken,” Cora
said.
</p>
<p>
“Of course! I ought to have remembered.
Well, I bought two tickets for the opera from
those men at a reduced price.”
</p>
<p>
“And couldn’t your friend go with you?” asked
Belle sympathetically.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. He came for me all right. But when
we went to go in they wouldn’t let us.”
</p>
<p>
“Who wouldn’t let you, those two young men?”
asked Cora eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“No, I only wish it had been the young men.
I’d have had ’em arrested. But the doorkeeper
would not let me and my friend in on those tickets.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Because he said they were counterfeit. And
after my friend had given me his good money for
them. I was that angry I could have cried! Counterfeit
tickets! What do you know about that?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—OFF TO CAMP</h2>
<p>
“Really, were they bogus tickets?” asked Cora
after a pause.
</p>
<p>
“And wouldn’t they let you in?” Bess cried.
</p>
<p>
“How could they tell they were counterfeits?”
was Belle’s question.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause some one else had our seats, or the
seats our tickets called for,” said Miss Magin, the
manager of the tea room. “This is how it was. I
got all ready to go—it was my day off, you know,
and I had a new dress. Had my nails manicured
and went to a hair dresser, for I wanted to look
nice. My friend is some swell dresser himself, and
you know how it is. You want to be a credit when
a person goes to the trouble to take you out.”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” Cora murmured.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I did look nice, if I do say it myself,”
went on Miss Magin, “and I was quite pleased
when I handed my friend back a dollar.
</p>
<p>
“‘What’s this for?’ he asked me.
</p>
<p>
“‘What I saved on the tickets,’ I told him, and
I mentioned how I’d bought two from the fellows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
who were here trying to sell some railroad transportation
as well. My friend was quite pleased,
of course, for he has to work hard for his money.
’This’ll do to help get a lunch after the show,’ he
said, and I was glad.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we got to the opera house all right, but
they wouldn’t let us in. That is, they wouldn’t
give us the seats our coupons called for. We did
get in, but when we went to the seats there was a
couple already in them.
</p>
<p>
“My friend thought the usher had made a mistake,
and there was a mix-up for a while. Then
the usher got the other couple’s coupons and they
were the same number as ours. They called the
manager, and he said our tickets were counterfeit.
</p>
<p>
“First my friend wouldn’t believe it, but the
manager showed by the other tickets taken in that
ours were different. The print was the same, and
so was the color of the pasteboard, but it was stiffer
than the regular tickets. There was no way out
of it. We had been cheated, and so had some
other people who had bought tickets from those
fellows. There was quite a disturbance.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s too bad!” exclaimed Cora. “Then you
didn’t see the opera after all?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sure I did!” exclaimed Miss Magin. “My
friend wouldn’t see me disappointed. He bought
other tickets, though they weren’t as good as the
ones I had—or thought I had.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“And they really were counterfeit?” repeated
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but cleverly done. It was only the quality
of the paper, or pasteboard, that showed,” went
on the tea room manager. “If we had gotten
there first we might have had our seats without any
trouble, though of course when the folks came in
that had the real tickets it would have been found
out, I s’pose.”
</p>
<p>
“And you say others also bought the bogus tickets?”
Cora asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, quite a few. Got them from the same fellows,
too, who told the same story about being
hard up for cash, and wanting to sell the tickets
they’d purchased.”
</p>
<p>
“Were they the same young men?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“The descriptions were the same as the two
who were here, and who must have taken your
auto, Miss Kimball. When I found out our tickets
were worthless I told the manager about your car,
though of course he had heard of it from reading
the paper. Oh! I just wish I could have them arrested!”
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” agreed Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Could they find out where the tickets were
printed?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Not just by looking at them,” answered Miss
Magin. “The bogus ones looked for all the world
like the real ones, even to the company’s name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
that was printed on them. But the opera house
manager kept those my friend and I turned in and
said he’d make an investigation. Say! I felt pretty
cheap when it turned out I’d bought bogus tickets
with my friend’s money.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you couldn’t help it,” Cora said, her
chums murmuring their agreement.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I meant all right,” Miss Magin went on,
“but I cost my friend more than if I hadn’t a’ been
so soft-hearted wanting to help out those fellows
who told a hard-luck story.”
</p>
<p>
“They’ll be caught some day,” declared Bess.
“Printing bogus theatrical tickets isn’t easily done.
Care has to be used, and sooner or later those fellows
will be arrested.”
</p>
<p>
“The sooner the better,” said Cora. “I want
my car back.”
</p>
<p>
The girls and the manager talked for some little
time longer about the happenings of the night before.
Presently a man alighted from a taxicab, or
rather, one of the town’s few jitney cars, and entered
the tea room. He looked rather sharply at
our friends—at least so Cora thought—and, taking
a seat at a table not far away, ordered a cup
of coffee and a sandwich.
</p>
<p>
He spoke casually to the waitress, and as Miss
Magin, as was her custom, walked up to see if the
service was satisfactory, he spoke also to her pleasantly,
and she replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“Was it one of the young ladies here who recently
purchased some bogus theatre tickets?” the
man asked, after some casual remarks.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you haven’t any more to sell!” retorted
the manager, a bit sharply.
</p>
<p>
“No. I am a detective sent out by the agency
which prints theatre tickets for many shows. This
isn’t the first time we have had trouble, and I want,
if possible, to get on the track of the persons responsible.
Do you mind telling me all you can of
this?”
</p>
<p>
Of course Miss Magin was only too glad to do
so, and, incidentally, she mentioned the loss of
Cora’s automobile. Naturally that brought our
friends into the conversation, and the detective,
who introduced himself as Mr. Boswell, went over
to the girls’ table. He spoke of having been for
some time unsuccessfully on the trail of the bogus
ticket sellers.
</p>
<p>
“Taking automobiles is a new line for their activities,
though,” said Mr. Boswell. “This may
make it easier to catch them.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” suggested Cora, “we are not altogether
certain that the same persons who sold Miss
Magin the tickets took my auto.”
</p>
<p>
“Very likely they were,” declared the detective.
“They probably realized that they had done all the
illegitimate business possible in this neighborhood,
and they wanted to get as far away as they could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
before the fact about the tickets became known.
An auto offered the simplest means.”
</p>
<p>
“I should have locked the ignition switch,” said
Cora. “I usually do when I get out. But we
thought we would stay only a little while, so I
didn’t do it this time.”
</p>
<p>
“Too bad,” said Mr. Boswell. “If I get on the
track of your car, Miss Kimball, I’ll let you know.”
</p>
<p>
He made a memorandum of the description of
the two men as furnished by Miss Magin, and took
his departure, promising to let Cora hear from him
in case anything developed.
</p>
<p>
“More of the mystery,” remarked Bess, as she
and the others were on their way back in the automobile.
“What with this and what may happen
at Camp Surprise, I can see we are in for a busy
summer.”
</p>
<p>
And busy enough the girls were during the next
week. There were trunks to pack, messages to
send to the caretakers at the camp, dresses to have
finished in time, and many odds and ends to be
looked after before leaving for so long a time.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a nice dancing pavilion not far away,”
Cora told her chums. “And of course there’ll be
one or two formal affairs at a neighboring hotel.”
</p>
<p>
Hazel Hastings had come on to be Cora’s guest
and was staying at the Kimball house. She was
the same sweet girl as before, though a little older,
and not quite so timid as she had been.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
Paul was the same jolly chap, quite engrossed in
his automobile business, but not so much so that he
could not enjoy the little outing in prospect.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve sent a description of your car, with the
number of it, the number of the engine and other
identifying marks, to all the second hand dealers,”
he told Cora. “If it’s offered for sale to any one
in the dealers’ association I’ll hear of it and there’s
a chance that we’ll get it back for you.
</p>
<p>
“Of course there are some ‘outlaw dealers’ who
do not belong to the association, and who might
take a chance on buying a stolen car,” said the
young automobile agent. “But we can’t help that.
I think we’ll get your machine sooner or later.”
</p>
<p>
Cora was grateful for Paul’s efforts, but she had
about given up hope. The police had secured no
clews, and, though they professed to be active,
there really was little for them to do.
</p>
<p>
The motor boat had been overhauled and put
in shape for the trip up the Chelton river. Though
the craft offered accommodations for sleeping on
board they did not plan to use the berths on this
occasion. They were to make an early start and
reach Riverhead, the end of navigation on the
Chelton, early in the afternoon. From Riverhead
they would go to Camp Surprise in wagons of the
buckboard type, made with wooden slats for
springs, very comfortable to ride in over rough
roads.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
The boys were to go with the girls, Jack and
his sister acting as chaperons for the others until
camp was reached, when Mr. and Mrs. Floyd
would perform this office.
</p>
<p>
Light baggage would be taken with them on the
boat, the trunks being sent on ahead.
</p>
<p>
“And we’ll take lunch along, of course,” Bess
said.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” echoed her sister. “We don’t
want to go hungry any more than do you.”
</p>
<p>
The day of departure came at last. Bess and
Belle were early at Cora’s house, and found her,
Jack, Paul and Hazel busy making the final preparations.
</p>
<p>
The valises and bundles were carried down to
the motor boat, good-byes were said over and over
again, various cautions were given by Mrs. Kimball
and Mrs. Robinson, and then Cora, standing
at the wheel of the craft, steered out into the
middle of the pretty stream.
</p>
<p>
“Off for Camp Surprise!” she cried gaily.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—JACK’S BATH</h2>
<p>
Out into the sunlit Chelton river swung the
smart motor boat with Cora at the wheel. The
sun glinted on the water, it reflected from the polished
brass rail and the white forward deck of the
craft, it sparkled from the brass letters of the name—<em>Corbelbes</em>,
and danced in javelins of light on
the little waves.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Corbelbes</em> was the latest name of the motor
boat which had been variously christened at times.
The craft was owned jointly by Cora, Belle and
Bess, and in accordance with their agreement they
had in turn the privilege of naming it, such name
to be used during a whole season.
</p>
<p>
In turn the girls had adopted various more or
less classical nomenclature. Each one’s time having
expired, it came to Cora again, and she confessed
that she did not know what to select.
</p>
<p>
“Let me name the boat for you,” suggested
Jack. “I’ve thought of a swell name.”
</p>
<p>
“Something ridiculous, I’m sure of that,” ventured
Cora.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, something really classy. How’s this,” and
Jack quickly printed on a piece of paper the name
now glinting on either bow of the craft.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Corbelbes</em>,” repeated his sister. “That isn’t
half bad. What is it, Spanish or Latin?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s French for curling iron and face powder,”
laughed Jack.
</p>
<p>
“You mean thing!”
</p>
<p>
“No, it isn’t, Sis. Don’t you see, it’s the first
part of the names of all three of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, so it is.” Cora was smiling now.
</p>
<p>
“What better name could you have for a boat?”
Jack demanded. “It’s something distinctive and
individual.”
</p>
<p>
Cora and her chums agreed with him, and the
motor boat became the <em>Corbelbes</em>, and as such had
remained.
</p>
<p>
“Does she steer all right, Cora, with the new
tiller ropes on?” asked Jack, as he lolled lazily on
one of the cushioned lockers, which, at night, could
be turned into comfortable bunks.
</p>
<p>
“A bit stiff,” responded his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Well, the ropes will stretch, after they’ve been
used a bit, so it’s just as well to have them tight
now. You get quicker action when you turn the
wheel, though the river will not be crowded after
we get up a way.”
</p>
<p>
Bess, Belle and Hazel busied themselves setting
to rights their various possessions in the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
cabin, and then they sat out in the wicker chairs in
the after part of the craft, where Jack and Walter
were. Paul seemed to find entertainment up in the
bow with Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the eats?” demanded Walter, when
they had been under way for perhaps a half hour.
“Didn’t I see you smuggling something on board,
Bess?”
</p>
<p>
“Eats? Now?” cried Jack. “And if you saw
Bess have anything it was a box of chocolates.”
</p>
<p>
“It was not, Jack Kimball!” retorted the pretty,
plump twin. “I’ve given up chocolates.”
</p>
<p>
“For how long?” he teased.
</p>
<p>
“For ever. I’m eating lime drops and lemon
drops now. Have some?”
</p>
<p>
“I knew I saw you have something,” declared
Walter. “Why, they’re chocolates after all!” he
went on, as he helped himself to what Bess offered.
</p>
<p>
“I know they are, but the chocolate coating is
very thin,” she said. “They’re sour inside.”
</p>
<p>
“Sort of Christian Science treatment,” remarked
Jack. “Bess couldn’t altogether give up her
chocolate, so she takes it in homeopathic doses.
Whew! they <em>are</em> sour!” he cried, as he bit into one
of the candies, making a wry face.
</p>
<p>
“Fruit acids make one thin, I read,” Bess stated,
“so I had these made to order.”
</p>
<p>
“Bess Robinson, you never did!” voiced her sister
in surprised accents.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why shouldn’t I? They didn’t cost any more
than the others. All the candy shop did was to dip
their regular lime and lemon drops into chocolate
for me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” exclaimed Belle. “Did you hear that,
Cora?”
</p>
<p>
There was no reply from the girl at the wheel.
She and Paul were busy talking.
</p>
<p>
“Let her alone,” urged Bess. “She knows about
my candy. I told her.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, don’t disturb ’em,” agreed Walter. “But
I want something more substantial than candy.
Didn’t you bring anything else, Bess?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we have a nice lunch, but I’m not going
to have you spoil your appetite by eating now,” declared
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know how hard it is to spoil his
appetite,” laughed Jack. “I’ve tried several times
to find out just where the vanishing point is, but
I haven’t succeeded. I’ve begun to believe that his
appetite is like the poor—always with us—or
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Base traitor!” retorted Walter, reaching out
to punch Jack, but finding him too far away he did
not exert himself.
</p>
<p>
The Chelton river was a busy place in the
neighborhood of the town where our friends lived.
On the way up the <em>Corbelbes</em> passed a number of
craft, some of them slow-moving coal or grain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
barges, others passenger steamers, and not a few
pleasure craft. Those in charge of the latter recognized
the <em>Corbelbes</em> and saluted her with the
regulation three whistles, which Cora returned.
</p>
<p>
“We couldn’t have had a better day,” remarked
Paul, as he sat beside Cora.
</p>
<p>
“No, it’s perfect. If the weather only behaves
when we get to camp we’ll be in all sorts of ways
obliged to it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I guess it will,” was the comment. “Look
out for that fellow, Cora. He doesn’t seem to
know which way he wants to go.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been noticing him,” and Cora looked at a
man in a rowboat who was yawing from side to
side as though unfamiliar with the proper method
of navigation.
</p>
<p>
Cora blew the whistle sharply as the man seemed
about to cross her bows, and this further confused
him so that he was really in danger of being run
down.
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” cried Paul again, instinctively,
though he knew Cora knew how to manage the
boat.
</p>
<p>
And she proved that she did by quickly reversing
the propeller, while a series of sharp blasts
informed any craft coming astern to look out for
themselves.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with you?” demanded Paul,
as the <em>Corbelbes</em> passed the man in the rowboat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
“You ought to take lessons before you come out on
the river.”
</p>
<p>
The man looked frightened but did not answer,
pulling awkwardly away.
</p>
<p>
“What are you trying to do, Cora?” demanded
Jack. “Have an accident before we’re fairly
started? Better let me steer.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not, indeed! It wasn’t my fault!”
</p>
<p>
“I should say not!” cried Paul. “That fellow
was a dub!”
</p>
<p>
That was the only near approach to a collision,
though the river was unusually crowded that morning.
In a little while, however, the water traffic
thinned out, and Cora did not have to devote so
much attention to the wheel.
</p>
<p>
“Say, isn’t it time for lunch now?” demanded
Walter, insinuatingly.
</p>
<p>
“It’s only eleven,” announced Belle, with a look
at her wrist watch.
</p>
<p>
“That’s his regular feeding time—at least he’ll
say so,” put in Jack, before his chum had a chance
to answer.
</p>
<p>
“I had an early breakfast,” put in Walter in extenuation.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, give the child something,” laughed
Bess, “and let us have peace!”
</p>
<p>
Sandwiches, cake and other things were brought
out, set on a table which unfolded from the side
of the boat, and the merry chatter was soon interspersed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
with periods of silence to allow a chance
to eat.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get there in good season,” Cora was
saying, when the engine gave a sudden combined
cough, wheeze and sneeze, and stopped.
</p>
<p>
“No gasoline!” cried Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed not!” answered Cora. “Both tanks
are full.”
</p>
<p>
“Ground wire broken,” suggested Paul.
</p>
<p>
A hasty look at the conductors proved this
theory to be wrong.
</p>
<p>
“Then it’s the carburetor,” Jack affirmed. “The
worst possible place for trouble. I’ll look after it,
Sis. I’ve had the dingus apart, and if anybody
knows about its insides I do. Throw that anchor
overboard, Wally, and I’ll tinker with the troublemaker.”
</p>
<p>
A small anchor splashed into the river, while
Jack, putting on an old jumper and overalls, kept
for such emergencies, took off the carburetor and
proceeded to examine it, from cork float to butterfly
valve.
</p>
<p>
“Must be poor gasoline they’re serving us
lately,” he said. “It’s awfully dirty. Look!” and
he held up his grimy hands.
</p>
<p>
“Have you found the trouble?” Cora asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it was the air intake valve. Little speck
of carbon in it prevented the proper mixture. I’ll
have it fixed in a jiffy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
Jack proved the truth of his assertion by replacing
the carburetor, and, a little later, by starting
the engine without any trouble.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” cried Paul. “That’s what it is to
have a good mechanician aboard.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a wonder you wouldn’t qualify yourself,”
said Jack grimly. “Look at me! I’ll have to take
a bath!” and he held up his hands, grimier than
ever.
</p>
<p>
“There’s some of that mechanic’s soap—with
pumice stone in it—in one of the lockers,” volunteered
Cora. “Use that, Jack.”
</p>
<p>
The anchor was hauled in and the <em>Corbelbes</em>
started up the river once more. Jack knelt down
on one side of the stern deck, and, reaching down
into the river, wet his hands, rubbing on them some
pasty soap, guaranteed to remove grime of all
kinds and leave most of the original skin.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s the camera?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“What for?” demanded her sister.
</p>
<p>
“I want a view of Jack at his bath. Doesn’t he
look cute?”
</p>
<p>
“Wait until I pose for you,” Jack suggested,
making a lather of the soap. “I’m a dandy when
it comes to poses. Just watch me.”
</p>
<p>
He stood up on the after deck, but his foot
slipped on a bit of the lather that dropped from his
hands, and, a moment later, Jack plunged overboard.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—THE STORM</h2>
<p>
“Oh, Jack!” cried Cora, as she had a hasty
glimpse of her brother making a rather ungraceful
dive over the side of the <em>Corbelbes</em>. “Oh!”
</p>
<p>
Her words were echoed by Bess and Belle, and
while they started up, overturning the chairs on
which they had been sitting, Cora, alive to the
emergency, quickly threw in the reverse clutch, and
a smother of foam arose under the stern of the
boat as it lost way.
</p>
<p>
Nor had Walter and Paul been idle. The former
seized a canvas covered cork life ring, and,
waiting a moment to catch a glimpse of the bobbing
head of his chum, threw the ring to him, with
a cry of:
</p>
<p>
“There you are, Jack!”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go after him in the boat!” called Hazel’s
brother, for a small dingey was riding astern of the
larger boat, and Paul now hauled this toward the
side.
</p>
<p>
There was no need for any one else to go overboard,
for Jack, as his boy and girl chums well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
knew, could swim excellently, and he had fallen in
with only overalls and jumper on, which made raiment
almost as light as a bathing suit. True, he
had on his shoes, but in several tests at summer
camp Jack had swum across a lake with all his
heavy clothes on.
</p>
<p>
Still Paul was not sure but what his chum might
have struck his head going overboard, and in this
case it would be advisable to have the little boat
ready.
</p>
<p>
“There he is—he’s all right,” cried Walter, as
he saw Jack striking out for the motor boat, ignoring
the life ring.
</p>
<p>
“Get it, Jack! Get it!” cried Cora, indicating
the white, floating object.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t need it!” Jack sung out, cheerfully
enough. “What do you think I am, an invalid?”
</p>
<p>
However, he was glad enough to crawl into the
smaller boat, which Paul sent over toward him,
for Jack found his shoes heavy, and the side of the
<em>Corbelbes</em> was high out of water, making it difficult
for one to reach the gunwale.
</p>
<p>
“All right?” asked Cora, as Jack sat dripping
on the stern seat.
</p>
<p>
“Sure I’m all right. I was going in for a swim
anyhow, and this saved me the trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, come on board and we’ll start again,”
Cora said. “Pick up the ring, Paul. I don’t want
to lose it!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, my captainess!” and he saluted with
an oar.
</p>
<p>
“How did it happen, Jack?” asked Walter,
when his chum, dripping, was safe on board again.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody pushed me! I think it was Hazel,”
and he winked at the others while he gazed as severely
as possible (which was not greatly) at the
blushing girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Kimball! I—I did not!” cried
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, how very formal! <em>Mr.</em> Kimball!”
mocked Bess. “Since when, Hazel?”
</p>
<p>
“Since he accused me that way.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I’ll withdraw the accusation if you’ll only
call me Jack! I love to hear you say that, Hazel!
Call me Jack.”
</p>
<p>
“Silly!” muttered Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Mushy, I call it,” declared Bess. “Downright
mushy!”
</p>
<p>
“You’re jealous,” added Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Say Jack!” commanded the dripping owner of
the name, “or I’ll come over and sit by you, Hazel,
and I’m almost sure that blue dress of yours
spots.”
</p>
<p>
“It does! Oh, don’t let him come near me!”
begged Hazel, trying to retreat into the cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Say Jack then!” commanded the relentless one,
dripping at every step as he pursued her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—Jack!” she complied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
“Your brains seem to have gone overboard, and
not to have come back with you,” said Cora to her
brother. “Quit your fooling. You’re getting the
cushions all wet.”
</p>
<p>
Jack subsided after blowing a kiss to his sister,
and sprinkling her with water from his dripping
hair. Then the boat was put back on her course,
the dingey was made fast, the life ring put in place,
and there was peace and quietness once more,
broken only by Jack’s grunts and exclamations as
he struggled to get off his wet shoes.
</p>
<p>
“Cora,” called Jack, from the curtained cabin,
where he was changing into dry garments, “I didn’t
put an extra pair of shoes in your valise; did I?”
</p>
<p>
“I rather guess not,” was the quick answer.
</p>
<p>
“Then I haven’t any,” wailed Jack. “I’ll have
to borrow a pair of you girls’ slippers. The biggest
I can get—don’t all speak at once.”
</p>
<p>
There were some subdued giggles.
</p>
<p>
“Did I hear Cora say hers would be too big
for me?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do get sensible!” commanded his sister.
“There’s a pair of worsted bedroom slippers of
mine you can take until your shoes get dry. You
can’t stretch them any too much. Put your shoes
near the muffler. They’ll dry there.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and get all out of shape,” objected Jack.
“I’ll put them on the forward flag staff and let
the gentle breezes dry them. ’Tis Nature’s way.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’ll do nothing of the sort!” groaned Cora.
“What would people say on seeing a pair of shoes
at the top of the staff? Please put them near the
muffler and they’ll dry all right.”
</p>
<p>
This Jack did, the iron cylinder that received the
burned gases from the engine being quite hot, so
that the wet garments and shoes bid fair to dry
speedily. Jack, meanwhile, donned a pair of his
sister’s slippers—a pink one and a blue one, Cora
not having been able to find mates.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what’s in him to-day,” Cora confided
to Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“He’s awfully jolly, I think,” said Paul’s sister.
</p>
<p>
“Jolly? You wouldn’t think so if you had to
live with him as long as I have had to.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he always this way?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank goodness; it goes by streaks, like
the lean and fat in a piece of bacon.”
</p>
<p>
“The idea of comparing Jack to a piece of
bacon!” commented Bess, who overheard.
</p>
<p>
“Well, he is that way,” insisted Cora.
</p>
<p>
“I hope my shoes get dry by the time we reach
Riverhead,” Jack confided to Paul and Walter.
“I have another pair in my trunk, but that may
not be there when we get to camp. And I do hate
wet shoes to dance in.”
</p>
<p>
“Who said we were going to dance?” asked
Walter.
</p>
<p>
“I did,” replied Jack. “There’s a hotel not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
far from the camp, I hear, and the season ought to
be partly in swing now. Well, if you fellows
don’t want to go I can borrow your shoes.”
</p>
<p>
“Who said we didn’t want to go?” Paul cried.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, don’t bite me!” pleaded Jack, in falsetto
accents.
</p>
<p>
The little excitement caused by Jack’s involuntary
bath gradually subsided. He made a final
and fairly successful effort to rid his hands of the
grime caused by cleaning the carburetor, and then,
attired in dry garments, and with one pink and one
blue slippered foot resting “nonchalantly” (as he
called it) on the rail, he watched the receding,
wooded shores of the Chelton.
</p>
<p>
From somewhere in the distance a factory whistle
blew.
</p>
<p>
“One o’clock!” cried Jack. “Is dinner ready?
I say, Cora, I have a wonderful appetite!”
</p>
<p>
“Never knew you when you didn’t have,” she
replied.
</p>
<p>
“Why, we just had lunch—just before Jack fell
overboard!” ejaculated Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“That won’t make a bit of difference to him—or
them,” said Belle, with a resigned air. “We’ll
have to serve another meal I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“A regular one this time, if you please,” begged
Walter. “Those olives, anchovies and the caviar
sandwiches only made me a bit keen.”
</p>
<p>
The girls were nothing loath to put out the food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
again, for, truth to tell, the river air had given
them, as well as the boys, an appetite. They had
brought plenty with them, for though they had requested
Mr. Floyd to have supper ready when
they reached the bungalow (the first meal in camp
the boys were to share with the girls), still Cora
had feared they would arrive late, and had made
arrangements accordingly.
</p>
<p>
They had as much fun over the regular lunch
as they had had over the “temporary” one, as
Walter and the boys designated the first meal, and
the afternoon waned pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
“I hope we shall get to Riverhead before the
storm,” observed Cora, as she came back to take
her place at the wheel again, a post she had abandoned
while she helped the girls put away the
dishes and what was left of the food.
</p>
<p>
“What storm?” asked Paul.
</p>
<p>
Cora indicated a bank of sullen-looking clouds
in the west. They were sufficiently ominous to
cause Cora to speed up the motor a bit, and to request
her brothers and his chums to see to the side
curtains.
</p>
<p>
“We ought to get in long before that breaks,”
Jack declared.
</p>
<p>
But he did not count on the speedy approach of
the storm, nor on the fact that the boat ran into a
shallow section of the river, where there grew long
grass which got entangled in the propeller.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
Though the <em>Corbelbes</em> managed to force her
way through this patch of “seaweed” as Jack called
it, when she emerged into free water again the
motor could hardly turn the screw. It was necessary
to reverse the engine, to unwind the grass, and
even then some had to be pulled away with the boat
hook—no easy task.
</p>
<p>
And then, when they were once more under full
speed, the storm came down with a rush and a
roar, with blinding sheets of rain, with a wind
that caught the boat broadside, where the rubber
curtains made a wide sail area, and heeled her over
at no small angle.
</p>
<p>
With the rain came thunder and lightning, sufficiently
fierce and loud for a time to terrify at
least Belle, who was the most nervous of the girls.
</p>
<p>
“I can hardly see to steer,” said Cora, peering
out of the rain-drenched windows of the cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Want me to take the wheel?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you, I think not. We ought to be
almost there now. But I don’t know about going
over the mountain trail in this storm.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it will stop,” suggested Belle.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t act so,” commented Walter.
</p>
<p>
The thunder had almost ceased, and the lightning
was not so startling, but the rain came down
harder than ever.
</p>
<p>
“I declare I can’t see either bank of the river,”
Cora said. “I hope I shan’t run into anything.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
They kept on for perhaps an hour longer, the
rain never ceasing. But they were good and dry
in the snug motor boat.
</p>
<p>
“I think we’d better put ashore and find out
where we are,” suggested Jack, after a bit. “We
may have run past Riverhead, Cora.”
</p>
<p>
“Run past it! How could we, Jack? The river’s
almost too shallow for a rowboat past Riverhead.
We’d be aground.”
</p>
<p>
“Not necessarily. They’ve lately dredged a
channel about a mile beyond, to let boats bring ice
down from the houses up above. You may be
in the channel,” Walter said.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe—” began Cora, when suddenly
the boat ran against an obstruction. The occupants
were almost thrown off their feet. A grinding,
scraping sound was heard and Cora threw
out the gears.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why!” she cried, as she looked out into
the dark mist of the storm. “We’ve run ashore!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—TIED UP</h2>
<p>
Silence followed Cora’s startling announcement—that
is comparative silence, for the rain,
hissing into the river, and pelting on the deck and
cabin roof, made quite a noise.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that you say?” demanded Walter, arising
from a stern locker where he had been talking
more or less nonsense to Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Run ashore?” echoed Jack.
</p>
<p>
“At least I suppose it’s the shore,” said Cora,
who had stopped the engine, the controls being
near the wheel. “There aren’t any islands in this
part of the river; are there?”
</p>
<p>
“Not one,” said Jack. “It is the shore,” he
confirmed after a look through the cabin window.
</p>
<p>
“Any damage done, Sis?”
</p>
<p>
“Not to the shore, at any rate. We didn’t
hit very hard. I saw something looming up
through the mist and slowed down.”
</p>
<p>
“We must be up to Riverhead all right,” remarked
Bess. “Though I haven’t noticed anything
like a town.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
“You couldn’t notice much of anything in this
rain,” Cora said. “We’re not aground, at all
events,” for they could feel the boat moving down
stream under the influence of the current.
</p>
<p>
“Switch on the searchlight and see if we can
discover where we are,” suggested Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Good idea,” commented Captain Cora. A
push of a button and the small but powerful searchlight,
mounted amidships on the cabin roof,
gleamed out. It was operated by a storage battery,
which, in turn, was charged by a small dynamo
connected to the engine fly wheel. And by
means of a worm gear, operated by a wheel near
the steering apparatus, the light could be deflected
in any direction.
</p>
<p>
Cora trained it on the bank. Looking through
the rain-covered windows of the cabin the girls,
and their boy guests, saw a water-soaked bank,
covered with bushes and rushes. It was dusk now.
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t look like Riverhead,” commented
Jack.
</p>
<p>
“More like river-end,” said Paul. “Where in
the world are we?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ask me!” exclaimed Cora, a trifle nervously.
“I’m sure I did the best I could in the
mist.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you did, Sis,” said her brother soothingly.
“It isn’t any one’s fault. We’re all right.
The boat doesn’t seem to be damaged by trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
poke her pretty nose into the bank, and if we can’t
go on to Camp Surprise in the darkness and rain
we can go to some hotel and stay. There’s one in
Riverhead.”
</p>
<p>
Just then, into the radiance of the searchlight
stepped a man clad in yellow oilskins, rubber boots
and with a sou’wester on his head.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll ask him,” said Jack. “He’ll tell us where
we are.”
</p>
<p>
The individual—evidently a fisherman, as indicated
by his unjointed pole and a basket—stopped
in some surprise as he saw the big motor boat so
close to shore, with lights gleaming and the powerful
beams of the one on the cabin roof setting him
out in bold relief in its glare.
</p>
<p>
“How far to Riverhead, if you please?” called
Jack, sliding back one of the cabin windows.
</p>
<p>
“Riverhead?” cried the man, and surprise was
plain in his voice. “Why, Riverhead’s over on the
Chelton side, about ten miles from here.”
</p>
<p>
“On the Chelton side!” repeated Jack. “Isn’t
this the Chelton?”
</p>
<p>
“No. This is Batter Creek,” the man explained.
“The Chelton river branches off to the
right, six miles down. You must have taken the
left turn where Batter Creek runs into it. First
you know you’ll be up in the swamp.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-<em>night</em>!” cried Jack, with a tragic gesture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“On Batter Creek!” echoed Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Ten miles from Riverhead!” was Cora’s gasping
remark.
</p>
<p>
“No wonder the poor boat ran ashore,” commented
Bess. “She’d rather do that than get lost
in a swamp.”
</p>
<p>
“So this is Batter Creek,” went on Jack. “I
see how it happened. You steered over to the left
at the junction, Cora, instead of following the
right shore—I mean the right hand shore.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose I must have,” Cora admitted. “But
I couldn’t see in all that storm.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” said Hazel, slipping her arm
around Cora’s waist. “It wasn’t your fault.”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” added Walter and Paul in a
duet.
</p>
<p>
“Jack, please shut the window,” begged Belle.
“That is, if you have finished talking to that man.
The damp wind will——”
</p>
<p>
“Take all the frizz out of your hair—I know!”
Jack cut in. “All right. Much obliged to you,
sir,” he continued.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t mention it,” replied the man of the yellow
oilskins. “Quite a drizzle; isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Regular Scotch mist!” chuckled Walter, in exaggerated
Highland accents.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose we can get to Riverhead by turning
around, following the left shore here until we
come to the place where Batter Creek runs into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
the Chelton, and then go up the river?” suggested
Jack, as he slowly slid the window shut.
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” returned the fisherman. “But
don’t go up this creek any further, or you’ll run
aground in a swamp.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks,” called Jack. “Oh, I say, are you
going or coming?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean have you been fishing, or are you just
going?”
</p>
<p>
“Just going. They always bite pretty well for
me in a rain.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh. I thought maybe if you had any we’d
buy ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry, but I haven’t anything but shiners for
bait. I’m going down to the deep water.”
</p>
<p>
“What in the world did you want to buy fish
for, Jack?” asked his sister as he closed the window,
and the yellow figure splashed away.
</p>
<p>
“To eat,” was his answer. “We’ve got to have
supper; haven’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“But can’t we go on to Riverhead, and then to
the bungalow?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly,” declared Jack. “It isn’t so late, of
course. But this rain is going to keep up, if I’m
any judge, and though we might manage to reach
Riverhead, we certainly couldn’t undertake a ride
over the mountain trail in an open buckboard in
this downpour.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“But what are we going to do?” cried Hazel,
opening her eyes wide. She seemed in much distress.
</p>
<p>
“Do? Why, stay right here, my dear,” said
Jack. “That is, if you will allow that poetic license—because
‘dear’ rhymes with ‘here.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” murmured Hazel, blushing. “Stay
here?”
</p>
<p>
“We have remained on board over night,” Cora
remarked. “But we’ll be a bit crowded,” and she
glanced appraisingly at Jack and his chums.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry about us, Sis,” he hastened to assure
her. “We can bunk anywhere, or sit up. I
don’t feel sleepy anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“But we’ve got to eat,” said Walter. “Too bad
that chap didn’t have any fish. We could have
fried them on the gasoline stove.” The <em>Corbelbes</em>
was fitted up with a little galley, the girls often
having stayed on board for days at a time.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we can catch some ourselves,” suggested
Paul.
</p>
<p>
“No outfit or bait,” remarked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“A bent pin and a piece of string?” suggested
Paul, but not with any degree of enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ve got to do something,” Cora declared.
She had again set the engine in motion,
but it was running only fast enough to overcome
the sluggish current in the creek.
</p>
<p>
“Stay here,” urged Jack. “We know where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
we are now, but if we go down stream in the darkness
we may fetch up at a place we don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean tie up here?” asked his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Sure. Cast the anchor, set the riding lights,
make everything snug below and aloft, my captainess,
and turn in. Set an anchor watch, heave
the lead, and ’ware the lee shore and breakers
ahead! Yo ho! My hearties! The stormy winds
do blow, do blow, do blow!” and Jack began howling
an old sea-song at the top of his voice.
</p>
<p>
“Jack, be quiet!” insisted Cora. “You’ll arouse
the neighborhood.”
</p>
<p>
“There aren’t any neighbors here,” he laughed.
“The only one there was has gone fishing, and he
doesn’t mind! Yo, he ho!”
</p>
<p>
“I guess to tie up is the best thing to do,” said
Paul, and there was something in his manner that
caused Cora to say:
</p>
<p>
“All right, Jack. Drop the anchor, and we’ll
stay here for the night.”
</p>
<p>
“And then see about something to eat,” suggested
Walter.
</p>
<p>
Jack made a dash outside, shoved over the anchor,
took a turn of the cable about a deck cleat
and came back into the cabin. The <em>Corbelbes</em> was
tied up for the night.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—A NIGHT RIDE</h2>
<p>
“Well, now that we’re here——”
</p>
<p>
“Because we’re here,” Walter interrupted Cora,
in the words of the foolish song. “Excuse me,”
he added, as he caught her look, “I didn’t mean
anything special.”
</p>
<p>
“Now that we’re here,” Cora resumed, “hadn’t
we better——”
</p>
<p>
“See to the eats,” broke in Paul. “No offense,
loidy!” he hastened to add, imitating a tramp,
“but wees would loik a bit of a bite——”
</p>
<p>
“Speaking of bites,” laughed Jack, “some fish
wouldn’t go half bad.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you be quiet!” commanded Cora. “I
want to say something!”
</p>
<p>
“Say on!” urged Jack. “Now that we are here,
as snug as a rug in a bug——”
</p>
<p>
Cora reached for something, she was not just
sure what, and Jack, knowing that his sister had a
straighter aim than have most girls, cried:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t shoot, Davy Crockett, I’ll come down.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better,” Cora said, laughing in spite of
herself. “Now that we are here——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
“She said that before,” whispered Jack, but his
sister took no notice, going on with:
</p>
<p>
“We must see about something to eat. We have
enough for supper, but breakfast will be another
matter. I’d like to get some bacon and eggs.
That, with coffee, will make a good morning
meal.”
</p>
<p>
“And what, if I may be so bold as to ask,” came
from Bess, “is to be the menu for this evening.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have a look,” suggested Cora. Attached
to the small galley, in which was a gasoline stove,
was a sort of cupboard. An inspection of this did
not reveal as much as Cora had hoped for.
</p>
<p>
“There isn’t a great deal left; is there?” she
said.
</p>
<p>
“I should say not!” cried Jack, peering over
his sister’s shoulder. “Fellows, we’ve got to rustle
for the grub! Don’t all speak at once. Listen
to that!” and he signaled for silence, which, when
it came, enabled them all to hear the swish and
patter of the raindrops on the roof.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go,” offered Walter. “I’m hungrier than
any of you, I guess, and I have a pair of rubbers
in my valise.”
</p>
<p>
“Regular fireman you are,” commented Jack.
“Why didn’t you bring rubber boots?”
</p>
<p>
“And I see Cora has an umbrella,” Walter went
on, ignoring Jack’s sarcasm. “I’ll go out in the
rain, and——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
“Give a correct imitation of a duck doing its
Christmas shopping!” gibed Jack. “Wally, you’re
all right!”
</p>
<p>
“If you had some of his public spirit we’d all
be better off,” said Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t um be mad at um’s ‘ittle bruver!”
mocked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, quit it!” begged his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Where can you get anything to eat around
here?” asked Paul.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, but I can forage for it. The
presence of that fisherman clearly proves that this
is an inhabited land, and where there are inhabitants
there must be food. I may find a country
store, or, if I can’t find that, I’ll find a house, describe
our plight in such moving words as I am
able to command, and buy what they’ll sell.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like a cup of tea,” murmured Belle. “My
nerves——”
</p>
<p>
“Are nothing to what they’ll be when the ghosts
of Camp Surprise begin to make the stairs stand
on their head,” broke in Jack.
</p>
<p>
“We have tea,” Cora said. “I’ll put the kettle
on at once. It seems a pity to have you go out in
this storm, though, Walter.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mind a bit. I’m glad to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll say anything as long as there are ladies
present,” declared Jack. “But wait until you’re
gone. He’ll say you drove him to it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
Walter paid no attention to his tormenting
chum, but began talking to Cora as to what best
he had better try to get in the way of food, provided
he could find a store or a house where some
might be obtained.
</p>
<p>
And then, having donned his rubbers, and taking
Cora’s umbrella, Walter set off on his quest.
It was still raining hard, but the thunder and lightning
had ceased some time since.
</p>
<p>
While he was gone the others began their preparations
for spending the night on board. The
girls would occupy the main cabin, where there
were four berths. The after part of the boat
had been enclosed in heavy curtains when the rain
set in, and here the boys could sleep on the locker
cushions spread on the floor. They had done it
on one or two other occasions.
</p>
<p>
There were a few blankets, besides those for the
bunks, but the boys said they would not need many
coverings, as the night was warm.
</p>
<p>
Cora put the kettle on the gasoline stove, and
as soon as it boiled, tea was made. There was
condensed milk in the larder, and sugar for those
who wished it, though Bess bewailed the lack of
lemon, for she wanted to “reduce” she said, and
some one had told her lemon juice in tea was helpful.
</p>
<p>
Cora was setting out what remained of the sandwiches
and cake, and Jack was eyeing, rather dubiously, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
apology for a meal, when they heard
a hail:
</p>
<p>
“<em>Corbelbes</em> ahoy!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s Walter!” declared Paul.
</p>
<p>
“And may he come well-laden!” ejaculated Jack.
</p>
<p>
“You poor boy!” exclaimed Cora, sympathetically,
as Walter came dripping into the after cabin.
“Are you soaked?”
</p>
<p>
“Not quite so bad as that,” he answered, laying
down some brown-paper-wrapped bundles.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind how <em>he</em> is, what about the eats?”
asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“You are heartless,” said Hazel, and then she
wished she had not spoken, for Jack flashed a look
at her, and whispered:
</p>
<p>
“Can you blame me for being heart-<em>less</em> where
<em>you</em> are?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh!” she murmured.
</p>
<p>
“Found a store about half a mile down the—well,
I wouldn’t call it a road,” and Walter looked
at his mud-splashed feet. “Say, rather, down the
swamp. Found a store there, and I got a few
things.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say you did!” exclaimed Bess, who,
with Belle, had opened the packages. “This will
be fine,” for Walter had purchased jellies, jams,
some tinned meat, bacon, eggs and enough canned
food, together with some rather doubtful oranges,
to make a substantial meal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
“That looks good to me!” declared Jack, while
Walter divested himself of his rubbers, and put
the umbrella where it would not flood the cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, and even olives!” gasped Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Olives for Olivia,” crooned Walter. “Say,
Jack, s’pose those overalls you went bathing in
would be dry enough for me?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure! Try ’em on. You’ll look sweet in ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care whether I look sweet as long as I
feel dry,” retorted Walter.
</p>
<p>
And while the girls prepared the supper, he
changed to the garments Jack had used, they having
dried sufficiently.
</p>
<p>
With the hot tea, and with what Walter had
foraged for, a really good meal was made. The
young people were hungry, and their appetites
made up for any lack in the nicety of the food.
</p>
<p>
“It was a regular country store,” Walter explained,
“but they had some good things.”
</p>
<p>
“And now we have ’em,” murmured Jack, tipping
back on his stool contentedly.
</p>
<p>
It was still early, for the storm had brought
darkness ahead of time, and, unwilling to retire
so soon with no very good prospects of sleeping,
the boys and girls sat up and talked.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what Mr. and Mrs. Floyd will think,
when we fail to arrive on time,” remarked Cora.
“I hope they don’t send telegrams home, telling
the folks we have turned up missing.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe they will,” argued Jack.
“They’ll know the storm delayed us. And in the
morning we can send telegrams ourselves, notifying
our folks that we’re all right, any reports to
the contrary notwithstanding.”
</p>
<p>
The girls passed a fairly comfortable, and the
boys a rather uncomfortable night, but it could not,
as Jack said, last forever, and a bright morning
sun made them all forget the discomforts.
</p>
<p>
Hot coffee, bacon and eggs, that were fresher,
Cora said, than the high-priced ones at home, made
them all look at the day’s prospect with genial spirits.
</p>
<p>
“And now we’ll make another attempt to get to
Camp Surprise,” said Cora, as the anchor was
hauled up and the engine set in motion.
</p>
<p>
“I’m surprised that we didn’t get there before,”
Jack said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a miserable pun!” groaned Walter.
</p>
<p>
Good time was made to the junction where Batter
Creek flowed into the Chelton river. It was
not much of a junction and the creek was so unimportant
a stream that Cora and her friends had
never thought of going up it.
</p>
<p>
“But this time we did it in spite of ourselves,”
said Bess.
</p>
<p>
“It was only because of the mist and darkness
that I made the wrong turn,” declared Cora.
</p>
<p>
They stopped long enough to send reassuring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
telegrams home, and also one to Mr. and Mrs.
Floyd, explaining the delay.
</p>
<p>
Again they were on their way up the Chelton
river, and for a time all seemed to go well. But
four miles from their destination, engine trouble
developed, and when the cause of it was discovered,
it proved to be a break that needed the attention
of a machinist.
</p>
<p>
“We could leave the boat here and go on,”
Cora said, “but we have made arrangements to
have it taken care of at Riverhead, and the man I
have engaged won’t know what to think if we don’t
come.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s wait here until it’s fixed,” suggested
Belle. “We want to arrive in style. It won’t take
long, and to go on we’d have either to hire another
boat or go by wagon.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” Cora agreed.
</p>
<p>
The repairs took longer than they anticipated,
and it was not until late afternoon that they were
able to go on. This time they arrived safely at
Riverhead, shortly before dusk, which was the
time they should have been there the previous
evening.
</p>
<p>
The man who was to dock the <em>Corbelbes</em> was
on hand and took charge of the craft. He also directed
the party to the big waiting buckboard, in
charge of a driver, that had been sent by Mr.
Floyd to meet the girls and boys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’re a little late,” said the man. “Not that
I mind, but we’ll have to make a night drive of
it.”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t care,” Cora said, “as long as the
roads are safe.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they’re safe enough.”
</p>
<p>
“What about supper?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Floyd said she’d have it ready for you,”
the driver stated.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got some sandwiches and a box of candy,”
observed Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Then we won’t starve,” said Jack.
</p>
<p>
“May blessing be upon thy head!” intoned Walter.
</p>
<p>
The driver looked at them in a queer sort of
way, as though he did not know altogether how
to take them, and he was heard to murmur something
about “queer city folks.”
</p>
<p>
The valises and other belongings they had
brought along on the motor boat were put in the
big wagon, the driver climbed to his seat, and, with
the shadows of night falling, they set off up the
mountain for Camp Surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Some buckboard this!” remarked Jack, as he
surveyed the vehicle.
</p>
<p>
“It sure is,” responded Walter. “The largest
buckboard I ever saw.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—IN CAMP SURPRISE</h2>
<p>
“Isn’t it dark!” voiced Belle, nestling against
her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we don’t have many electric lights up
here,” chuckled the driver of the buckboard.
</p>
<p>
“How do you see the road?” asked Cora, the
wagon lurching along over the rocky way, though
riding much easier than an ordinary vehicle would
have done, for buckboards are made for just this
purpose.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t try to see it,” the driver said. “I let
the horses pick their way. They’re like cats, I
reckon—can see in the dark.”
</p>
<p>
“What sort of place is this Camp Surprise?”
asked Jack, giving Walter, next to whom he sat,
a nudge as a signal to play second to his game of
questioning. “We’ll get some inside information
about this business,” Jack said in an aside to his
chum.
</p>
<p>
“Camp Surprise?” repeated the driver. “Well,
it’s a mighty nice place, as far as scenery goes—for
them as likes scenery,” he hastened to add.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
“I don’t care much for it myself. There’s a waterfall,
and a little lake, though I don’t reckon you
could get your boat up to it,” and he chuckled.
“Yes, folks what come up here always like this
neighborhood, and Camp Surprise is one of the
best outfits around here. You boys are going to
take the small bungalow, I hear.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” assented Jack. “If we get there alive!”
he said quickly, for the wagon gave such a lurch
that Jack, who was on his feet to assume a more
comfortable position, nearly slid out.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, this isn’t anything,” the driver said. “That
stone must ‘a’ been put there since I come down
this afternoon,” and he chuckled again. “We’ll
get there alive all right.”
</p>
<p>
“But what I meant was,” went on Jack; “what
sort of place is our camp? It has a queer name,
you see, and they say—at least we’ve heard—that
queer things go on there. What are they?”
</p>
<p>
The driver was silent a moment, and then he
answered:
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t take much stock in them stories
myself. I never see anything out of the way happen.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t spoil all the romance that way!”
begged Cora. “Aren’t there any ghosts?”
</p>
<p>
“Ghosts! Huh!” the man fairly snorted. “I
never see any.”
</p>
<p>
“But about things being taken?” ventured Bess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
“And the furniture being moved?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” and the driver seemed out of patience.
“Things will be taken from almost any
camp or bungalow if you don’t watch ’em. Thieves
up here aren’t any more virtuous than in the city.”
</p>
<p>
“And didn’t you hear anything about chairs and
tables being moved about?” asked Cora.
</p>
<p>
The driver fidgeted in his seat.
</p>
<p>
“G’lang there!” he called to his horses.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you?” persisted Jack’s sister.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, there was some such story,” the driver
finally admitted, slowly. “But I reckon it was just
boys skylarking. That was all. Boys will go into
any place they can get in you know, and I reckon
when they found the bungalow of Camp Surprise
without any one in it they just naturally went in
and cut up.”
</p>
<p>
“If they try anything like that when we’re
around, there’ll be trouble!” threatened Jack.
</p>
<p>
Cora sighed.
</p>
<p>
“All the poetry seems to be going out of it,”
she said. “I hoped we would have at least one
visitation from the spirits.”
</p>
<p>
“You may yet,” Walter whispered in her ear.
“In my private opinion this driver person is concealing
something from us.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think so?” asked Cora, hopefully.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. He’s afraid we won’t stay if he tells all
the horrible details of the story.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“What object would it be to him to have us
stay?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he may get a percentage on our board.
Or perhaps he has the only mountain-cruising buckboard
in these parts, and he doesn’t want to lose
trade. Have done with thy queries, Friend Jack,”
he went on. “We’ll scare up a ghost or two for
the young ladies ourselves, if this sordid and heartless
driver person refuses.”
</p>
<p>
Jack left off with his questions about Camp Surprise,
and the conversation became general. The
driver, who volunteered the information that his
name was Jim Dobson, said there was good fishing
in the pool of water at the foot of the cataract.
</p>
<p>
“All you have to do is to throw in your baited
hook,” he told the boys, “and haul out as many
fish as you want for breakfast, dinner or supper.”
</p>
<p>
“That sounds good!” commented Jack. “I’m
glad I brought my pole.”
</p>
<p>
“Same here,” echoed Paul, who, when he had
time, was an ardent fisherman.
</p>
<p>
Up and up, and on and on they went over the
rough mountain trail, for they had to ascend to a
height of about fifteen hundred feet to reach the
reservation owned by a company which had divided
it into camps and bungalows.
</p>
<p>
“My, but it is dark!” said Cora, after a period
of silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
A lantern was slung under the buckboard, and
cast gleams of light on the ground, but the darkness
seemed only blacker by contrast. The horses,
however, did not seem to find any difficulties in
making their way. They never stumbled, though
the boys and girls tried in vain to distinguish anything
like a road ahead of them. The wagon
was going along in a lane of trees, which in most
places met in an arch overhead, thus cutting off
what little light might have come from the stars.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally there would be a break in this leafy
arch, and then glimpses could be had of the star-studded
sky above. It was a beautifully clear evening,
and warm enough to be comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Now and then Jim Dobson spoke without being
asked a question, but he was not unduly talkative.
He seemed to enjoy the chatter of the young folks,
chuckling now and then at some of their remarks.
</p>
<p>
As for Cora and the others they talked about
everything imaginable, as you may well imagine,
from the latest dance steps to what they would do
now that they were really starting their summer
vacation.
</p>
<p>
“Is there any golf up here?” asked Bess, who
had taken up the sport to “reduce.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, not enough to hurt,” the driver said.
“Once in a while I hear of a case, but it ain’t nothing
like as bad as hay fever, and there’s none of
that here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mercy!” whispered Bess to Cora. “I guess
he thinks golf is a disease!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t say anything. He’s real nice.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t. But I guess I’d better ask only plain
questions after this.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess so,” Cora agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Come on there, boys, not that way!” the driver
suddenly called, as he pulled his team to the right.
“They want to take the road home,” he explained.
“There’s a turn here.”
</p>
<p>
“How you know it I can’t tell,” said Jack. “It’s
all as dark as a pocket.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m used to it and so are the horses. We’re
on a private road now, leading to Camp Surprise.
Be there in half an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure this is the right road?” asked
Cora. “We don’t want to be lost again,” and she
mentioned their going up the creek instead of the
river.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sure, this is the right road,” the driver assured
them.
</p>
<p>
There was silence for a little while, and suddenly
Belle grasped Cora’s arm, and whispered:
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“Where?” inquired Cora, for Belle’s voice was
startling.
</p>
<p>
“Over to the left—in the woods. Don’t you see
something white?”
</p>
<p>
Cora looked where Belle directed. At the moment the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
others were deep in a discussion about
something of comparative unimportance.
</p>
<p>
“There!” whispered Belle, tensely, and she gripped
Cora’s arm hard.
</p>
<p>
“Yes—yes. I see it!”
</p>
<p>
“It—it looks like a—a ghost!”
</p>
<p>
They both saw something white that seemed to
float, rather than move among the trees, and Cora
was about to call it to the attention of the others
when it disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say anything about it,” she quickly whispered
to Belle. “Of course it wasn’t a ghost. It
may have been a wisp of fog, or some one going
through the woods. Then there’s that—oh, what
do they call that light which comes from rotting
wood?”
</p>
<p>
“You mean <em>ignis fatuus</em>?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; that’s it. Will-o’-the-wisp some folks term
it. It comes from phosphorus. It may have been
that.”
</p>
<p>
They went on a little farther, and suddenly a
light shone through the woods, while a dull rumble
and roar, increasing in intensity, came to the
ears of all.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Camp Surprise,” announced the driver.
“That’s the waterfall you hear. Here we be!”
he called in louder tones, as an approaching lantern
flashed through the dark forest.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—DISAPPOINTMENT</h2>
<p>
“Well, well! Glad to see you!” called a small,
grizzled, but cheerful-faced man, as he came out
to the buckboard. “Got here all right did you?”
</p>
<p>
“This is Mr. Floyd,” explained the driver.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we’re here,” said Cora. “Sorry to be so
late, but we had engine trouble and——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t make no manner of difference at all.
We’re used to seeing people come early and late.
I’ll help set your things inside. Here comes Mrs.
Floyd.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that them?” asked a woman’s voice. “The
Kimball party?”
</p>
<p>
“They’re here,” her husband answered while
the boys helped the girls down from the wagon,
and the driver and Mr. Floyd looked after the
baggage.
</p>
<p>
“Glad to see you all!” went on Mrs. Floyd, who
was the same genial sort of personage as her husband.
“I was afraid you’d give us another disappointment,
and not get here.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’re here,” affirmed Cora, “and we’re
sorry to give you so much trouble by being late.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“No trouble at all!” the chaperon assured them.
“Come right in. Supper is all ready and——”
</p>
<p>
“Whoop!”
</p>
<p>
“Supper is my middle name!”
</p>
<p>
“Lead us to it!”
</p>
<p>
Thus in turn cried Jack, Walter and Paul.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Floyd looked a bit startled as she stood
revealed in the light of a lamp, the illumination
streaming out of the door of a big bungalow.
</p>
<p>
“It’s only the boys,” explained Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Only!” accented Bess with a resigned expression.
</p>
<p>
“Jack!” chided Cora. “Why don’t you behave?
Hazel, say something to your brother, you
and I have more responsibility than the twins.”
</p>
<p>
Hazel did not know what to say, and the girls
could not help laughing, in spite of themselves at
the antics of Jack and his two chums.
</p>
<p>
“Welcome to Camp Surprise,” said Mrs. Floyd
as the girls followed her into the house, or rather,
bungalow, for it was of that style of architecture,
and was but a story and a half high. The boys
followed the girls, Mr. Floyd and the driver
bringing up the rear with the valises.
</p>
<p>
“Do we eat with the family, or at second table?”
Jack demanded.
</p>
<p>
“You shan’t eat with us if you don’t behave,”
his sister threatened him. “Do quiet down, boys.
Mrs. Floyd may not like——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t worry about <em>me</em>, Miss Kimball,”
the chaperon hastened to say. “I’ve raised a family,
and I know what <em>boys</em> are.”
</p>
<p>
“If she doesn’t she’ll find out before those three
leave,” observed Belle.
</p>
<p>
The buckboard rattled off in the darkness and
the young people were thus thrown on their own
responsibilities as far as getting away from the
place was concerned, for it was near no railroad.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t he afraid to go home alone?” asked
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Who?” inquired Mr. Floyd.
</p>
<p>
“That driver; Mr. Dobson I think he said his
name was.”
</p>
<p>
“Afraid? Him? I guess not!” exclaimed the
caretaker. “What’s there to be afraid of?”
</p>
<p>
“The dark woods,” said Belle. “Cora and I
thought——”
</p>
<p>
“Belle, dear, don’t you think we’d better see
to our baggage?” interrupted Cora with a sharp
glance at her chum. She raised her eyebrows
meaningly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I suppose we had. Of course he, being
a big man, wouldn’t have anything to be afraid
of,” she concluded, nodding in the direction of Mr.
Dobson.
</p>
<p>
“But there’s nothing here to be afraid of,” insisted
Mr. Floyd. “Leastways, nothing you can
put your hand on, though——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“Harry,” said Mrs. Floyd, and it seemed as
though there was a caution in her voice, “I think
I’ll have to ask you to bring in some more wood.
I want a hot fire to finish supper.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” he answered, and went out.
</p>
<p>
“Now if you young ladies want to freshen up
you’ll have time before I get the meal on the
table,” went on the chaperon. “The boys can go
with my husband and they’ll be shown where they
are to stay. Their bungalow is just across on the
other side of the mountain stream. I don’t know
just what arrangements you made about the meals
for the young men, Miss Kimball——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they’re to shift for themselves,” said
Jack’s sister. “They are so uncertain, going and
coming, that no earthly mortal could tell when to
feed them. They were to have supper with us to-night,
and perhaps breakfast in the morning, my
mother said. But after that they’ll look after
things themselves. They’d rather, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” assented Jack, while the others nodded
assent. “We can’t be positive when we’ll be on
hand.”
</p>
<p>
The boys followed Mr. Floyd, while Cora and
her chums looked about the bungalow before going
to their rooms, where their trunks had been carried,
having arrived safely the day before.
</p>
<p>
The main floor of the bungalow consisted of one
big living room, with three smaller rooms opening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
off from it. These could be used as sitting rooms
or bed rooms, folding bunks making beds at night.
The living room, as also an alcove dining room,
was simply but tastefully furnished, with rustic
furniture. At one end was a big stone fireplace,
though it was so warm now that no blaze was
needed.
</p>
<p>
A broad stairway gave access to the upper story
and here the bedrooms were. Though the rooms
there were not high-ceilinged they had such large
windows that plenty of air was assured. There
were two bath rooms, a spring up in the hills filling
a tank on the roof so that a supply of running
water was to be had.
</p>
<p>
The bedrooms each contained a white iron bed
and just enough furniture to make a simple life
agreeable. There was a touch of daintiness, mingled
with utility, and the girls were delighted with
their apartments.
</p>
<p>
Soap and water, with a mere suggestion of talcum
powder, wonderfully refreshed the four, and
they were ready for the appetizing meal, odors of
which were wafted up from the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
This was in a separate part of the bungalow, and
the quarters of the caretaker and his wife were in
a building connecting with the bungalow by a covered
passageway.
</p>
<p>
“There come the boys back!” exclaimed Hazel,
giving a hasty glance in a mirror, as she floated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
out of Cora’s room, having come in to borrow
some hairpins.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you can hear them before you see them,”
agreed Jack’s sister. “I hope Mrs. Floyd has
enough for them to eat.”
</p>
<p>
“And for us, too. I’m hungry, Cora. But she
looked like a good cook.”
</p>
<p>
“Mother said she was. Well, are you ready
to go down?” she called to Bess and Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Whenever you are,” answered the plump twin.
</p>
<p>
They found the boys waiting for them in the
dining room, which opened off the living room at
the rear, and a supper which met the most exacting
requirements of Jack and his chums was soon
on the table.
</p>
<p>
“How do you like your quarters?” asked Cora
of her brother.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t be better. Not that we’ll be in them
much, though. We’ll be over here or out-of-doors
most of the time.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t live here,” Cora warned him.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’ll be glad enough to have us when the
ghost begins to walk,” prophesied Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Has anything really strange happened here,
Mrs. Floyd?” asked Cora, determined to get at
the bottom of the matter.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I suppose you must have heard the stories
about Camp Surprise,” answered the chaperon.
“It would be strange if you had not. And I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
admit that there have been little happenings here
that I can’t explain.”
</p>
<p>
“Such as——,” hinted Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, disturbances in the bungalow when we
weren’t here. Misplaced furniture, and once some
silver was taken. But that might be the work
of tramps. I don’t set much store by that. However,
don’t let it worry you. I don’t believe anything
will happen while you’re here.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope it does,” Jack said. “We’re going to
lay the ghost.”
</p>
<p>
Talk went on during the meal and toward the
close Jack said:
</p>
<p>
“This sure is a fine place! You ought to see
the waterfall.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it nice?” asked Cora. They could hear the
roar of it as they sat at table.
</p>
<p>
“It’s great! I’m going to take some pictures of
it,” said Walter. “And the way to our bungalow
is over a bridge just made for lovers to stand on
and look down into the water.”
</p>
<p>
“As long as they don’t <em>fall</em> down into the water
they’ll be all right,” commented Paul. “But it
sure is nice. Our shack is just across the stream.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be all ready to respond to the first alarm,
girls,” promised Walter, as the boys left the main
bungalow later in the evening to repair to their
own. “If the tables begin dancing, or the chairs
do a jig, call us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s a little far to shout,” said Cora. “We’ll
have to put up some sort of telephone from one
bungalow to the other.”
</p>
<p>
It must be admitted that the girls were a little
nervous when they went to bed that night. Tales
of queer happenings, not easily explicable, are apt
to get on the nerves of the best of us. But the
young people were tired from their journey and
lack of restful sleep the night before, so they had
hopes of a good rest.
</p>
<p>
Cora was awakened by a shout under her window.
</p>
<p>
“I say! Sis! Cora! Stick out your head!” cried
Jack.
</p>
<p>
Slipping on a robe Cora went to the casement.
</p>
<p>
“Go on away, Jack!” she ordered. “Let the
girls sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Sleep? Why, it’s nine o’clock,” he said. “Say,
did the ghost walk?”
</p>
<p>
Cora yawned.
</p>
<p>
“Not even a creep,” she said. “I didn’t hear a
sound.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if that isn’t poor luck!” exclaimed Jack
in disappointed tones. “There we go and stay
awake half the night, expecting a summons to capture
a spirit, and nothing happens. Camp Surprise!
Where’s the surprise come in, I wonder.”
</p>
<p>
But there was plenty of time, as Jack soon
learned.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—THAT NOISE</h2>
<p>
One after another the girls drifted lazily downstairs
to the dainty breakfast Mrs. Floyd had prepared
for them.
</p>
<p>
“I just couldn’t bear to get up,” confessed Bess,
“though I knew it was a perfectly glorious day
outside.”
</p>
<p>
“It is wonderful,” declared Cora.
</p>
<p>
“How do you know? Have you been out?”
asked Hazel, with a questioning look at Cora’s
negligee.
</p>
<p>
“Peeped from the window—Jack called to me,”
explained his sister.
</p>
<p>
“I was <em>so</em> tired,” said Belle. “I thought I never
would get enough sleep. I wouldn’t have gotten
up if a ghost had called me.”
</p>
<p>
“Jack was a bit disappointed that we didn’t call
on them for help,” remarked Cora, and she detailed
her brother’s morning salutation.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s all perfect nonsense,” declared
Belle. “Of course I don’t mean you, Cora,” she
said, “for you only told us what you heard. But
I don’t believe a thing will happen.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“I hope nothing unpleasant does,” remarked
Bess, tucking back a rebellious lock of her pretty
hair, and glancing at her pink nails which she kept,
as Jack taunted her, “in a state of faultless repair.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you sleep well?” asked Mrs. Floyd, coming
in with more coffee.
</p>
<p>
“Fine,” answered Cora. “And please don’t
think we are going to impose on you in this way
every morning. We came up to help with the
work, and we’re going to do it. But this morning——”
</p>
<p>
“I know, my dear. You girls don’t exactly need
any beauty sleep,” and she beamed at the four
pretty faces that smiled back at her, “but you must
have been tired after your trip. I don’t in the
least mind.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll find us quite energetic after this,” predicted
Belle. “That is all but my sister, and you
see she is——”
</p>
<p>
“Belle Robinson! If you talk about me that
way I’ll—I’ll—— Oh! why do you all poke fun at
me?” and Bess seemed quite distressed.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t any more,” promised Belle. “She is
trying to ‘reduce’” she added to Mrs. Floyd, “so
let her do all the work she wants to. We shan’t
stop her.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the program to-day?” asked Hazel, as
the girls finished their coffee. “It is perfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
glorious outside. From my window I can see part
of the fall. It’s beautiful. I could sit and look
at it forever.”
</p>
<p>
“And not want anybody to share the view?”
asked Cora, pinching her blushing cheek.
</p>
<p>
“The witness refuses to answer,” mocked Belle.
“But we mustn’t dawdle here all day. Let’s go and
get dressed, and by then——”
</p>
<p>
There came a knock at the door.
</p>
<p>
“May we come in?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“We—want—our—breakfast!” bawled Jack
and Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Mercy no! Don’t let them in!” cried Bess,
beating a precipitate retreat.
</p>
<p>
“We—are—coming!” chanted Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Stay out a minute,” ordered Cora. “Don’t be
afraid, the door’s locked,” she added to her companions.
“We’ve just finished,” she went on in
louder tones. “Hurry with your breakfasts, and
then prepare to give us a good time.”
</p>
<p>
“Your majesty’s wishes shall be obeyed,” declared
Paul, and as the girls went upstairs to put
on more conventional garments, the boys hurried
in, bubbling over with good spirits, greeting Mrs.
Floyd effusively, and preparing to devour everything
in sight, which not very remarkable feat
(for them) they nearly accomplished.
</p>
<p>
“Did that waterfall bother you?” asked Jack,
of his chums.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“Kept me awake a little,” admitted Walter.
“Sounded a bit like the surf at first, and I
dreamed I was down at Crystal Bay again.”
</p>
<p>
“We sure had a swell time down there,” said
Jack.
</p>
<p>
“I like the mountains better,” confessed Paul.
“This place suits me.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be all right,” Jack said. “Now then,
let’s see what’s doing.”
</p>
<p>
“Fishing for mine,” declared Walter. “That
pool below the fall looks good to me.”
</p>
<p>
The others also voted to try their luck as disciples
of Izaak Walton, and presently, with rods
and lines, having dug some worms where Mr.
Floyd showed them a place, they were patiently
waiting on the bank of the stream that flowed away
from the waterfall.
</p>
<p>
Camp Surprise was situated amid one of the
wildest and most desolate parts of the mountains
west of Chelton. It was remarkable, in a way,
that such a lonesome place could be found so close
to such a number of large and thriving towns and
villages. But it was this wildness and isolation
that gave it the peculiar charm, and which had
led the land company to establish a number of
camps and bungalows in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>
So rugged and diversified was the scenery, that,
with the exception of the two bungalows occupied
respectively by the boys and girls, no other two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
buildings were in sight of each other. Though
not far removed from one another the dwelling
places were off by themselves, giving a seclusion
so often demanded by those who go to summer
resorts.
</p>
<p>
At present, as the season had hardly opened,
there were no other visitors at Camp Surprise,
though many were expected later in July and August.
Camp Surprise was not the real name of the
place, which was called by the development company,
Mountain View. But Camp Surprise had
been applied because of the queer happenings, as
has been intimated, though so far our friends had
seen no occasion for such appellation.
</p>
<p>
The waterfall and the stream which flowed from
it divided practically in half the area of land owned
by the Mountain View Company. Having its origin
some miles back in the mountains, the stream
was augmented by brooks, creeks and other
streams until, on reaching Camp Surprise, it had
become almost a river.
</p>
<p>
Flowing along peacefully, through green meadows,
or down the slope of some rocky hill, the
river came suddenly to a great cleft in the hills,
and down this it plunged in a most beautiful fall,
from a height of about fifty feet, and perhaps a
hundred feet in breadth.
</p>
<p>
At the foot of the fall was a deep pool, worn in
the limestone rocks by the erosion of the falling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
water, and there the white foam boiled and bubbled
in a miniature whirlpool and rapids until the
stream slipped farther on down the side of the
mountain, in a series of little cascades, in which
were, so it was said, many fishes.
</p>
<p>
The boys had selected as their spot a quiet one,
where a sort of eddy, or back-water, made a quiet
pool that looked, as Jack said, “like a regular
bachelor apartment for fish.”
</p>
<p>
“Keep still! Don’t move!” called Belle, as she
and her chums, now with all their “war paint on,”
as Walter hinted, approached the three young
men.
</p>
<p>
“What is it—the ghost or the furniture mover?”
asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“I just want to get a picture,” Belle explained,
snapping her camera. “You look so respectable
to what you do ordinarily.”
</p>
<p>
“Just for that you shan’t hold my hand!” declared
Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t come any nearer,” warned Walter. “I
think I have a bite. Yes! He’s on!” he cried
as the tip of his pole bent, and a moment later he
hauled out a flashing beauty.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I want to catch one!” cried Cora, who
was as ardent a lover of outdoor sports as any of
her boy friends.
</p>
<p>
“You may take my pole,” offered Paul, as Walter
unhooked his fish.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, I don’t want to deprive you,” Cora
objected.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll sit near and watch you—have all the fun
and let you do the work,” he retorted. And the
boys and girls were soon together on the bank.
</p>
<p>
Luck was fairly good, and presently enough
fish had been caught for a “good mess,” as Mr.
Floyd observed when he came past.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll cook them for you,” offered Belle.
“Won’t we, girls?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know how?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Listen to him!” mocked Bess.
</p>
<p>
As Mr. Floyd and his wife had to go to one of
the more distant bungalows, to see about some repairs,
and as they would be gone most of the day,
Cora and her chums agreed to be the housekeepers
and to let the boys share the lunch with them.
</p>
<p>
“Which isn’t such a concession after all,” Jack
said, “seeing as how we caught the fish.”
</p>
<p>
“I caught one myself,” Cora declared.
</p>
<p>
“With Paul’s pole, so that doesn’t count,” retorted
her brother quickly.
</p>
<p>
They had a jolly time at lunch and spent the
afternoon roaming about the mountainside. The
girls took pictures of the fall, which was really a
beauty-spot, and some of the prints were afterward
enlarged, and they made most charming pictures.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the hotel,” said Paul, as they came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
out on a ledge of rock, and looked down in a
valley. “That’s where I’m going to have some
tango tea.”
</p>
<p>
“To-night?” asked Jack. “I’m with you if you
go.”
</p>
<p>
“Count me in,” added Walter. “I haven’t had
a good dance, not since——”
</p>
<p>
“The one with me,” cut in Cora, for she and
Walter were good partners.
</p>
<p>
“Right—oh, little one!” he cried. “Shall we
all go down to-night?”
</p>
<p>
The hotel was about a mile from the Mountain
View property, and was quite a well-known hostelry,
though the season was not yet in full swing.
</p>
<p>
“Some other night,” suggested Cora. “We
haven’t really gotten settled yet, and we don’t
know what time Mrs. Floyd will come back. Besides,
do they let any others than guests and their
friends dance?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I guess so,” said Walter. “We’ll find out.
But if you don’t want to go to-night we’ll wait.”
</p>
<p>
This was agreed to, and the rest of the day was
spent on the part of the girls in getting their rooms
in order, putting away their dresses and arranging
for supper, for they were going to do much of
their own work in camp, Mrs. Floyd being more
of a chaperon and general manager than housekeeper
or cook.
</p>
<p>
The boys said they would shift for themselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you going to get your suppers?” asked
Cora of her brother, as she saw him and his two
chums going down the road about five o’clock in
the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“Later,” he answered. “We’re going for the
mail now. It gets in about this time, and Walter
is expecting a letter.”
</p>
<p>
“No more than you are!” was the quick retort.
</p>
<p>
“Bring us all one!” called Bess. “Does the mail
really come up here?”
</p>
<p>
It did, twice a day it developed, coming to the
little village of Mountain View, which was about
a mile from Camp Surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe there’ll be some word about your car,
Cora,” said her brother.
</p>
<p>
“That’s too good to hope for, Jack.”
</p>
<p>
There was a letter for Cora from her mother,
but there was no news of the car. And as there
were epistles also for Bess, Belle and Hazel, the
boys took great credit to themselves for having
fulfilled the commands of the girls.
</p>
<p>
“And we think we ought to be rewarded, too,”
said Walter.
</p>
<p>
“What form ought the reward to take?” Cora
asked.
</p>
<p>
“The form of supper,” was the quick answer.
“We don’t feel like pitching in and opening a tin
of corned beef just now. Feed us to-night, and
we’ll rustle the grub for ourselves after this.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, in view of the fact that you’ve been so
nice to us, we will. Shan’t we, girls?” asked
Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Yes!” came in an unhesitating chorus; and
once more the boys ate bounteously with no effort
on their part.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Floyd and her husband returned about
eight o’clock, to find the young people playing
games in the big living room, and having a jolly
time.
</p>
<p>
They planned an excursion for the next day, to
include a stop at the hotel to ask about dance privileges,
and then, this having been arranged for,
good nights were said.
</p>
<p>
Cora, whose room adjoined that of Belle, was
awakened some time in the night by a touch on her
arm.
</p>
<p>
“Yes! What is it?” she asked, sitting up quickly,
and reaching for the little electric flashlight
she always had under her pillow. “Oh, it’s you,”
and she revealed Belle’s face. “What’s the matter—are
you ill?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but listen! Did you hear that—that
noise?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—WAS IT THUNDER?</h2>
<p>
The silence of Cora’s room, into which Belle
had tiptoed, was broken only by the accentuated
breathing of the two girls.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t hear anything,” began Cora. “Are
you sure——”
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” interrupted her chum. “Did you
hear it then?”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Cora was not aware of anything,
and then there seemed gradually to come to her a
dull, scraping sound. Perhaps it would be more
correct to call it a vibration. If you have ever
tried to raise a window which fits loosely in the
frame sidewise, as compared to the other direction,
and have felt it go up in a series of vibrations,
you will understand what is meant. The
whole room seemed to tremble like the shaking of
the window.
</p>
<p>
The whole bungalow, too, seemed to be vibrating
and delicately trembling from some cause—a
deep, low and hardly audible sound that was, in
effect, more sensation than noise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s the waterfall,” said Cora. “Don’t be a
goose, Belle!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not. It’s a noise. Can’t you hear it above
the sound of the water?”
</p>
<p>
Cora listened more intently.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I can,” she reluctantly confessed. “It’s
like the rumbling of a wagon going past the
house.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Belle in a whisper. “But it isn’t
a wagon. There isn’t any out at this hour, and
the noise is in this bungalow, not outside.”
</p>
<p>
Cora agreed to that, also. She snapped on the
switch of her little portable light, so that it would
glow without the necessity of holding her finger
on the push-button, and then she slipped on her
robe, and put her feet in slippers. Belle was similarly
attired.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Find that noise,” whispered Cora. “But don’t
let’s wake up the others. It may be—nothing,
and they’d only laugh.”
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be nothing,” insisted Belle. “There
it sounds louder than ever.”
</p>
<p>
Together they went silently to the door of
Cora’s room. But either their movements or the
queer noise had awakened Bess in the adjoining
apartment.
</p>
<p>
“Is that you, Cora?” she called.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It’s nothing. I’m going to get a drink,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
Bess. I am,” she added in a whisper to Belle, to
justify herself.
</p>
<p>
“Bring me one,” begged Bess, sleepily.
</p>
<p>
It was evident that the noise which had alarmed—or
if not alarmed, had awakened—Belle, had
not disturbed her sister. For as Belle and Cora
went toward the door they could both hear and
feel the vibration more plainly now.
</p>
<p>
“What can it be?” asked Belle. “Some one trying
to get in?”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” chided Cora.
</p>
<p>
“But it sounds like raising a sticking window.
Are you going to call Mr. Floyd?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish he weren’t so far off,” said Cora, pausing
undeterminedly in the middle of the room.
“He might just as well be in another building as
where he is. I don’t like going through that connecting
passage. And he and his wife both sleep
soundly. She told me so.”
</p>
<p>
“We ought to have some means of summoning
them—or the boys,” continued Belle.
</p>
<p>
“We can always scream,” Cora remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and startle every one. I almost screamed
when I heard the noise, and then I thought I’d
come in to you.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad you did. Can you hear it now?”
</p>
<p>
They were out in the hall, and could see the light
that was kept aglow in the bath room. Cora
switched off her electric.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t hear it,” affirmed Belle. “The noise
has stopped.”
</p>
<p>
It had, that was certain. The silence of the
night outside was broken only by the distant roar
of the waterfall, a sound with which by this time
the girls had become so familiar that they did not
notice it unless they listened especially for it, as the
receiver of a wireless message must be tuned to
catch the wave impulses of a certain length.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t hear it,” said Cora, breathing softly,
as Belle was doing.
</p>
<p>
There was no more noise.
</p>
<p>
“Could it have been distant thunder?” asked
Cora, when a minute passed in silence—and a long
minute it seemed to the waiting ones.
</p>
<p>
Belle stepped to the window and looked out and
up at the sky.
</p>
<p>
“The stars are shining,” she said. “If there is
a storm it is a distant one, and one that far off
wouldn’t sound so near. I don’t believe it was
thunder.”
</p>
<p>
Whatever it was, the sound was not repeated.
Together Cora and Belle got a drink in the bath
room, and brought one to Bess. Cora called
softly to her, but the plump twin had gone to sleep
again, without waiting for the water. Cora set it
in a chair by the bed and came out of the room
as softly as she had gone in.
</p>
<p>
“No use letting her know about it,” she remarked to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
Belle. “And we won’t tell anything in
the morning, until we hear what the others have
to say.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed Belle. “I’ll lie with you a
while.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” assented Cora. She understood Belle’s
feelings.
</p>
<p>
The two girls talked in whispers, straining their
ears for a repetition of the strange noise, but none
came, and finally Belle, who was fighting off sleep,
announced that she was going to her own room.
</p>
<p>
Cora and Belle looked significantly at one another
across the breakfast table, and Bess remarked:
</p>
<p>
“Did you hear me knock it over?”
</p>
<p>
“Knock what over?” asked Cora, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“The glass of water in the chair by my bed.
I didn’t know it was there, and just before daylight
I awoke, and as I put my arm out of bed I knocked
the glass to the floor. I thought sure you must
have heard it.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” Cora replied. “Did you break it?”
</p>
<p>
Bess shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“It fell on the rug, but the water splashed in
my ties. I’ll have to wear my high shoes until the
others dry. Why didn’t you tell me the water
was there?”
</p>
<p>
“You were asleep when I brought it in,” Cora
said, “and I felt it was a pity to disturb you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“What were you prowling around for?” asked
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, just for fun,” Cora said, with another
warning look at Belle.
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t hear anything,” the latter said
to Cora when they were alone a little later.
</p>
<p>
“No, and Mrs. Floyd or her husband didn’t
either, for they didn’t say anything.”
</p>
<p>
“Unless they heard it and don’t want to tell
us.”
</p>
<p>
“Why shouldn’t they tell us?” Cora asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they might think we’d go away if the queer
things begin happening.”
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t so very queer—just a noise,” declared
Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Was it just a noise?” asked Belle, suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know—was it—or—wasn’t it?” Cora
questioned.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we’ll have to let it go that way,” Belle
decided. “Here come the boys. Shall we tell
them?”
</p>
<p>
“No—that is, not directly. I’ll see if I can’t
find out in an indirect way.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, I’ll leave it to you.”
</p>
<p>
After some general talk when the boys had
come in, Cora brought the subject around to the
waterfall.
</p>
<p>
“Have you boys gotten used to the noise of it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
yet?” she asked. “You’re nearer to it than we
are. Does it keep you awake now?”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t anything keep me awake,” yawned Jack.
“I don’t get half enough sleep as it is.”
</p>
<p>
“You certainly slept soundly last night,” said
Walter.
</p>
<p>
“How do you know? Did you stay awake to
find out?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but I heard it thundering, and I called
to you that you’d better put your window down,
for your room faces the west and most storms
come from there this time of the year. You didn’t
answer so I concluded you must have been sleeping.”
</p>
<p>
“I was,” declared Jack. “Thunder, eh? I
didn’t hear it.”
</p>
<p>
“It was only a rumble,” Walter said. “I didn’t
stay awake longer myself than to hear that.”
</p>
<p>
“They heard it, too,” said Belle, when she and
Cora had walked off by themselves.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed her chum. “But was it thunder?”
</p>
<p>
“We’re right back where we started,” laughed
Belle, “arguing in a circle. Let’s forget it.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—A NARROW ESCAPE</h2>
<p>
But though Cora and Belle agreed to drop the
matter of the unexplained noise, they could not dismiss
it from their minds. Several times that day
Cora would notice Belle in a brown study, and on
taxing her with it would be met with the statement:
</p>
<p>
“I can’t think what caused it.”
</p>
<p>
“That noise you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Wasn’t it queer?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, not so very. At home we wouldn’t give
it a second thought.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Belle, “but there are so many
ways of explaining noises in town, and so few
ways up here. I wonder if that is the beginning
of the surprises, Cora?”
</p>
<p>
“If it is they aren’t so unpleasant. Noise never
hurt any one.”
</p>
<p>
So they said nothing to the others about the little
disturbance in the night, and the only remark
the others made, having any reference to it, was
that of Walter’s about thunder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“It must have been thunder,” Cora said, “for
if the noise had been in our bungalow the boys
couldn’t have heard it in theirs.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how they could,” Belle agreed.
</p>
<p>
“But, all the same, I’m going to have some way
of calling to Jack and the others without screaming
our lungs out,” declared Cora. “It’s only right
to be able to summon them if we want them. One
of us might become ill, and they’d have to go for
the doctor. I’d rather call Jack than Mr. Floyd.”
</p>
<p>
Cora spoke to her brother that afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“We should have some sort of speaking tube,”
he assented. “I might rig up one of the string
telephones we used to make with tin baking powder
boxes that served both as transmitter and receiver.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you do it?” asked Cora.
</p>
<p>
“I guess so.”
</p>
<p>
“I know something better than that,” Paul put
in. “There’s a toy telephone that comes now,
made of string, but the baking powder boxes are
replaced by wooden cylinders with parchment
tightly stretched over one end. You can hear
quite well with them.”
</p>
<p>
“Where can we get it?” asked Cora.
</p>
<p>
“I have one,” Paul said. “I bought it just before
we left to come up here, intending to give it
to a kid cousin of mine, but I forgot to mail it.
You can use that if you like.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“Just the thing!” exclaimed Jack. “The dear
girls can’t get along without us after all; can
they?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t flatter yourself that we’re as fond
of you as all that,” laughed Belle. “But we do
like to have you within call—especially up here.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, have you seen any suspicious characters
lurking around?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Nary a lurk,” responded Cora. “We’re just
getting ready for emergencies.”
</p>
<p>
The toy telephone was strung that day from
the girls’ bungalow to that of the boys’, and it
worked quite well. As simple as it was, and it
scarcely could have been more simple, talk could
be plainly heard over it. The string took up the
vibrations imparted to the parchment by the voice,
and transmitted them across space to the other
end of the line. Of course the string had to be
tight, and it must not touch anything in its course,
or the vibrations would have been interfered with.
But space was what they had most of in Camp
Surprise.
</p>
<p>
“To my mind the camp isn’t living up to its
name,” declared Paul, after the telephone had
been put up and tested, the boys sending any number
of foolish messages over the string. “No, sir!
There hasn’t been a surprise worth talking about,”
went on Paul. “Why doesn’t something happen?”
</p>
<p>
“Give it time,” suggested Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that noise was the start,” said Cora
to Belle when they were alone.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
The trip down to the hotel had given the young
folks the information that there were dances twice
a week, the Saturday night “hop” being quite an
event. They were cordially invited to attend, and
the first Saturday night in camp they took advantage
of the chance.
</p>
<p>
The crowd was not large, but, as Walter said,
it was “nice and comfortable,” and the girls and
boys thoroughly enjoyed the dance. The hotel
proprietor introduced them to some other young
folks and, as was voted by Jack and his chums
afterward, “a large and glorious time was had by
all.”
</p>
<p>
“What a splendid moon!” cried Belle, as she
walked along with Jack on the way home. “It’s a
shame to go to bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s don’t!” proposed Paul. “Let’s go down
where we left the motor boat and have a ride.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s don’t!” cried Cora. “Walk over that
rough mountain road at this hour of the night?
I guess not!”
</p>
<p>
“But look at the moon!” begged Paul. “The
glorious moon!”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve been looking at it too long already,”
was Cora’s retort. “I guess you’re looney.”
</p>
<p>
And so, laughing and joking, they walked on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“This is how it goes!” said Belle suddenly,
seemingly apropos of nothing at all, and, at the
same time she began to step backward and forward
in a peculiar manner in the road.
</p>
<p>
“What in the world——” began Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“That new Cortez step the girl in pink was
doing with that nice man dancer,” Belle explained.
“I’ve been puzzling over it. I hoped he would
ask me to dance, but he didn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, I like that!” cried Walter. “Didn’t I
ask you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but you can’t do that step. I remember
now how it went. I was watching that couple.
It’s a rocking step forward, then one back, step
back with the left, draw the right and go forward
again with the left, see!”
</p>
<p>
She executed it there in the road, her shadow,
cast by the moon, bobbing curiously back and
forth.
</p>
<p>
“It is pretty,” agreed Cora. “How does it
go?”
</p>
<p>
Belle and she took a dancing position and Cora
had soon acquired the new Cortez step.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve got me doing it!” cried Jack.
“Come on, Hazel, I’ll show you.”
</p>
<p>
“He doesn’t even know himself,” derided Cora.
</p>
<p>
“You watch!” challenged Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he can do it,” said Belle, as she looked
at Jack and Hazel. For Hazel was a natural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
dancer and, it developed, she, too, had been watching
the girl in the pink dress.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here we are,” said Bess, as they reached
their bungalow. “I’m tired.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that all you’re going to say, after we took
you to the dance?” demanded Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t we get asked in to have some cake and
chocolate?” questioned Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we?” queried Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Please do!” urged Paul.
</p>
<p>
And they did.
</p>
<p>
The plans for the next day included a long walk
up the mountain to a place where it was said a
wonderful view could be had. They were to take
their lunch and stay all day, for they could not
get back to the bungalow by noon.
</p>
<p>
“All aboard!” cried Jack, as he and his two
chums called for the girls, crossing the rustic
bridge at the foot of the fall. “All aboard!”
</p>
<p>
They started off merrily together, talking and
laughing. Walter had been down to get the early
morning mail, and there was a letter from Cora’s
mother, which said, among other things, that the
police had some clews to the men who took the
automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Good!” cried Jack, when Cora read out this.
“What’s the rest of it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it seems that some more bogus tickets
have been disposed of in places around Chelton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
and the men who sold them are described as the
same two who sold the coupons in the tea room.
The police seem to think there is a good chance
of getting them.”
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t see them have your car; did they,
Cora?” asked Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“No such luck, I suppose. But mother doesn’t
mention that.”
</p>
<p>
The view was voted all that had been said of
it, and after admiring it for some time, preparations
were made to eat lunch.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s sit down here,” proposed Cora, pointing
to a grassy spot in the shade of a big sycamore
tree. “Boys, spread the cloth and unpack the baskets.
Oh, what a curious root!” she cried, stooping
over toward something near a stone.
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” suddenly cried Paul, pulling Cora
back so sharply that she nearly toppled over. The
next moment Paul caught up a stone and threw
it with all his force at the spotted root. There
was an angry hiss.
</p>
<p>
“Narrow escape for you, Cora,” said Paul, a
trifle pale. “That was a copperhead snake!” and
he pointed to the writhing, dying reptile. His
stone had struck it fairly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—LOST</h2>
<p>
Cora Kimball was not an unusually nervous
girl, nor was she given to hysterical demonstrations,
but, somehow or other, she felt sick and faint
as she looked at the wiggling snake in its death
agony. Her eyes saw black, and she swayed so
that Paul stepped forward and slipped an arm
around her waist.
</p>
<p>
“I thought you were going to faint,” he said
in explanation.
</p>
<p>
“I—I was,” faltered Cora. “But I’ve gotten
over the notion. Thank—thank you, Paul.
Could I have a drink of water?”
</p>
<p>
Jack brought her some from a spring not far
away.
</p>
<p>
“Brace up, Sis,” he said with rough, brotherly
kindness. “You’re all right. That snake wouldn’t
have killed you anyhow. I’ve been bitten by ’em,
and it isn’t much worse than a mosquito.”
</p>
<p>
“You have?” cried Paul, in such a queer tone
that all save Cora realized that Jack was bluffing
for the sake of minimizing the effect on Cora.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
Jack made this plain to Paul by winking
quickly, and motioning to him to confirm what he
had said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, that’s right,” Paul went on. “I’d
forgotten that the copperheads aren’t poisonous
this time of year. You wouldn’t have been much
damaged, Cora, if you had been nipped by this
fellow,” and with a swift motion of his foot he
kicked the still writhing reptile to one side.
</p>
<p>
“Really?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Really.”
</p>
<p>
She looked relieved. The faint spell passed
and Cora smiled. The color was coming back
to her cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry I acted so,” she said, “but I have
a terrible fear of snakes, even harmless ones. I
thought this one was a curiously mottled root, and
I was going to pick it up. Suppose I had? Oh!”
</p>
<p>
She shuddered and looked at Paul.
</p>
<p>
“A miss is as good as a bird in the hand,” he
misquoted. “Come on now, let’s eat.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, old man,” said Jack to Paul, when they
were alone a little later, “that snake was a bad
chap, wasn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
Paul nodded in confirmation.
</p>
<p>
“I thought so,” Jack went on. “Just as well,
though, not to let her know, she’s so deadly afraid.
There’d have been trouble if she had been bitten?”
he questioned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Paul, simply. “Of course they’re
not sure death, but they’re dangerous enough.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought so. Shake!”
</p>
<p>
After the temporary scare of the snake had
passed, the picnic party made merry, laughing and
talking as they enjoyed the lunch the girls had put
up. It was a perfect day, rather warm, but cool
enough in the shade, and the mountain air was invigorating.
There followed a delightfully lazy
time, lying on the grass under the trees when
every one had eaten enough.
</p>
<p>
Then they packed up the rest of the food and
walked on, intending to make a circle and return
to Camp Surprise late in the afternoon. Now
and then they would come to some open space,
where the sloping mountain dropped away suddenly,
revealing below a vista which made them
pause in admiration.
</p>
<p>
Once they reached a point where they could
look down on Mountain View, and, though they
could not distinguish their own bungalows, they
could see about where they were situated.
</p>
<p>
Cora stood gazing down, in rather a thoughtful
mood. Walter was by her side, and noted her
abstraction. He held up the proverbial penny.
</p>
<p>
Cora shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“No. I won’t tell,” she said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
Walter guessed that she was thinking of the
snake, but he refrained from saying so. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
then Cora, fearing he might put a wrong construction
on her words added:
</p>
<p>
“I was just wondering when they were going
to continue.”
</p>
<p>
“What was going to continue?” he inquired.
</p>
<p>
“The surprises in our camp. You know——”
</p>
<p>
“Continue!” he interrupted. “I didn’t know
we had had any. I had begun to think it was all
a hoax.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” cried Cora, impulsively. “There
was a——”
</p>
<p>
She caught herself just in time, for she recalled
that she and Belle had agreed not to mention
the queer noise.
</p>
<p>
“Was it a ghost?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t anything,” Cora hastened to say.
“Look, see that curl of smoke. Isn’t it just like
a great big ostrich plume? What a hat it would
require to carry it! A giant’s hat.”
</p>
<p>
“Lady giant you mean,” said Walter. “But
look here, Cora, you are keeping something from
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all.”
</p>
<p>
Her manner was light, but Walter was a good
guesser.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you are!” he insisted. “Something did
happen, Cora. Go on, tell a fellow.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing really happened, Walter.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you heard something.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“How did you know?” she asked with a start.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I’d catch you. Come now. Own
up. You didn’t have that toy telephone strung to
our bungalow just on general principles. Did you
hear something, Cora?”
</p>
<p>
She looked around to make sure none of the
others were listening. Then she told Walter of
the queer noise, enjoining him to secrecy, however.
</p>
<p>
“So that’s what it was,” he said. “I thought it
was thunder myself, but if you heard it in your
bungalow it couldn’t have been.”
</p>
<p>
“And it was in our bungalow,” Cora said.
“Seemingly away down in the cellar, or sub-cellar,
if they have such a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Not as deep as that, I guess, Cora. But it was
a queer rumbly noise, though how I could hear it,
when it was under your bungalow I can’t imagine.”
</p>
<p>
“Unless it came from the waterfall.”
</p>
<p>
“How could it come from the waterfall?” Walter
asked.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Cora. “But there might
be some sort of hollow rock—blowing stones I
believe they are called—and when air is forced
into the hollow, by the action of the water, it might
give a roaring sound, and vibrate the earth.”
</p>
<p>
Walter considered a moment.
</p>
<p>
“It’s worth looking into,” he said. “I won’t
say anything, but the first chance I get I’ll have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
peep at the fall. I think I can get behind the
water curtain.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Walter! don’t take any risks.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t, Cora. But come on. The others will
wonder what we find to talk about and look at
here. Not that I wouldn’t want to stay talking a
great deal longer, but, well——”
</p>
<p>
“I understand,” and she smiled.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going berrying,” cried Bess, as Walter
and Cora came up to join the others. “That is,
unless you two want to stand there on the edge of
‘Lovers’ Leap’ and think sad thoughts.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that place called Lovers’ Leap?” asked
Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it might be if any lovers ever jumped
off there. Do you want to go berrying?”
</p>
<p>
“Surely,” said Cora, and Walter nodded assent.
</p>
<p>
The berry hunt was not very successful, though
a few early ones were found. However, it served
as an incentive to call the young folks farther
afield and up the mountainside, and they found
new beauties of nature at every step.
</p>
<p>
“This is the nicest place I was ever in,” declared
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“I like it, too, almost as well as any place we
ever picked out for our vacation,” said Belle.
“My hair doesn’t get so slimpsy as at the beach.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re getting beautifully tanned, instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
the lobster-red I always turn at the shore,” said
plump Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Say, hadn’t we better begin to think of turning
back?” asked Cora, after a while, when the
few berries that had been gathered had been eaten,
though Jack begged that they be saved for a pie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s getting late,” said Paul, looking at
his watch. “And we have a few miles to go.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say they were a few!” chimed in Walter.
“Seven at the least back to Camp Surprise.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say that!” begged Bess. “You’ll have
to carry me.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. We’ll make a litter of poles and
drape you over it in the most artistic fashion,” said
Paul. “Do you prefer to be carried head or feet
first?”
</p>
<p>
“Feet, of course. Riding backwards always
makes me car-ill.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s down hill, that’s one consolation,” came
from Jack. “Well, come on. All ready! Hike!”
and he marched off, swinging a long stick he had
picked up to use Alpine-stock fashion.
</p>
<p>
There was a patch of woodland to go through,
a fairly good path traversing it. The party of
young people went along, talking and laughing,
occasionally breaking into song as one or another
started a familiar melody.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Jack,” remarked Cora at length, “aren’t
these woods pretty long?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean oughtn’t we to be out of them by this
time? Are you sure you’re going the right way?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I never was here before,” said Jack,
“but I set our course by compass,” and he indicated
the little instrument on his watch chain.
</p>
<p>
“We started to walk due west,” he said, “up
the mountain. Now we are going east, as you
can see, because the setting sun is at our backs.
So we are going toward camp.”
</p>
<p>
“But we swung off to the right as we came up
the mountain,” Cora went on.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly, a sort of northwest course,” agreed
Jack. “And now we are heading southeast, which
is exactly the reverse. Look for yourself, Sis.”
</p>
<p>
He held out the compass, the tiny needle vibrating
as the instrument rested in his hand. Cora
was enough of a navigator to see that Jack was
right.
</p>
<p>
“Well, the only thing to do is to keep on,” she
said. “But I should think, by this time, we’d be
somewhere near the camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, not yet!” declared Jack. “We’ve got
miles and miles yet to go!”
</p>
<p>
“You horrid creature!” cried Bess. “Oh, my
feet!”
</p>
<p>
“This is the best exercise for reducing you
could have,” laughed Paul. “Come on, I’ll race
you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“Run? Never!” wailed the plump one. “I
can only hobble.”
</p>
<p>
They tramped on. The afternoon shadows
were lengthening now, and Cora’s face wore a
somewhat anxious look. They entered another
patch of woodland, and as they emerged into a
clearing Cora cried:
</p>
<p>
“Look at the sun!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with it?” Belle demanded.
“I think that is a perfectly good sun.”
</p>
<p>
“But it’s in front of us,” said Cora. “It’s in
front of us!”
</p>
<p>
For a moment the others did not realize what
she meant. They stared at the big red ball which
was sinking to rest amid a bank of gorgeously
colored clouds. Then Jack exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“By Jove! you’re right, Sis. The sun should be
back of us. We were going east, but we’ve got
turned around, and are going west.”
</p>
<p>
“Unless the sun has changed,” put in Paul, with
a laugh, “and is coming up in the morning. We
may have been walking all night and didn’t know
it.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s no joke,” said Cora, seriously, as the others
laughed. “Jack, we’re lost!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—TWO MEN</h2>
<p>
Naturally enough Cora’s words were echoed
aloud by some of the party.
</p>
<p>
“Lost!” cried Belle. “How do you know?”
</p>
<p>
“We’re going in the wrong direction,” Cora
said. “Don’t you know when persons get lost in
the woods they always go around in a circle?
Nearly always they turn to the right, as we have
done. I forget the explanation, but it has something
to do with the right side of the body being
stronger than the left. And that’s what we’ve
done. We’ve wandered around in a circle, so of
course we’re lost.”
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t follow at all,” declared Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” challenged Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Because the path may have been shifting.
We’ve only followed the trail through the woods.
We haven’t gone off it.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” chimed in Paul. “We’re still on
the path, and it must lead somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it’s a cow-path,” suggested Bess. “It’s
narrow enough for one.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, even a cow-path leads somewhere,”
said Hazel. “We’ll end up at a stable.”
</p>
<p>
“Or a dairy,” added Jack. “Some bread and
milk won’t go bad if we miss our supper.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we won’t miss it,” declared Walter.
“We’re bound to end up somewhere, and even if
we come out a mile or more from our camp. And
if we see a house, we can hire a farmer to drive
us over, if we’re too tired to walk.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we could do that,” Cora assented. “But
what plan is best to follow now? Shall we keep
on the way we are going, on this path, even though
it leads west and our camp is to the east? Or
shall we go back until we find a path extending
in an easterly direction?”
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” whistled Jack. “That sounds like a
question in my old school geography. What’s the
answer, Cora?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I knew,” said his sister. “Let’s take a
vote on it.”
</p>
<p>
They discussed the matter a little while, and the
general opinion was that it was better to go on
than to retreat.
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t see any houses in all the distance
we came,” said Walter, “and it is getting so late
now we may have to appeal to a farmer to drive
us back. I say go ahead, even if the direction
seems to be wrong. We may reach a house this
way.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess you’re right,” admitted Cora, “though
it seems illogical to go deliberately away from,
instead of toward, our camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it isn’t called Camp Surprise for nothing,”
suggested Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked her brother.
</p>
<p>
“I mean it may surprise us by appearing when
and where we least expect it.”
</p>
<p>
“You always were a hopeful child,” laughed
Paul. His sister blushed. “You believed in Santa
Claus long after I had detected our respected parents
sneaking down the back stairs with the presents,”
he continued. “Hope on, foolish one.”
</p>
<p>
“She may be right at that,” said Jack, championing
Hazel’s cause. “If the sun insists on appearing
where we think it oughtn’t to be the camp
may take a notion to do the same thing. Come
on! Forward!”
</p>
<p>
A little anxious, they kept on, rather tired, but
not greatly discouraged. Youthful hearts are not
made for discouragement, fortunately.
</p>
<p>
“Anything left to eat?” asked Jack after a bit,
when the path seemed to be shifting somewhat toward
the east.
</p>
<p>
“A little,” announced Walter, who was carrying
the basket. “But you can’t have any.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” demanded Jack, indignantly. “I
have as good a right as you. Who delegated you
to carry the rations?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nobody else seemed to want to. Now I’m
in charge of the commissary department, and I’m
going to put you, and myself included, on short
rations. We may have to stay out all——”
</p>
<p>
“Ahem!” interrupted Paul, giving Walter a
nudge. “Do you see anything like a house through
the trees? Cut out that talk about having to stay
out all night, if that’s what you were going to say,”
he added in a quick whisper.
</p>
<p>
“It was,” Walter admitted. “But I’ll cease.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better. We don’t want the girls to get
nervous.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see any house,” Jack reported, having
looked in the direction indicated by Paul.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I saw smoke, and where there’s
smoke there’s generally a house or a camp,” Paul
said. “However, I may have been mistaken.”
</p>
<p>
It was evident that he had been, but a little
later, as they once more emerged from the woods,
Cora gave a joyful cry and called out:
</p>
<p>
“There it is!”
</p>
<p>
“What, our camp?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“No, a house! See it?”
</p>
<p>
They looked to where her finger pointed. Undoubtedly,
it was a farmhouse, located on the farther
edge of the clearing in which they had halted.
There was a vacant space about it, and several
barn-like structures. But there was a curious lack
of life around the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe any one lives there,” said Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be a pessimist,” urged his sister. “Let’s
go and find out.”
</p>
<p>
They hurried toward the house, but the nearer
they approached it the more it seemed that it was
not a farmhouse in the ordinary sense of the
word. Though in the midst of cleared fields that
must at one time have been part of a farm, there
were no growing crops. The fields were overgrown
with weeds, there were no horses or cattle
to be seen, and no challenging dog rushed out to
bark at the boys and girls.
</p>
<p>
“Still some old man or woman may live there
who can put us on the right road,” Cora suggested.
“We won’t give up yet.”
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of Jack’s idea that the house was
uninhabited was given as they went up the
weed-entangled front path. And the sight of
broken windows, a door sagging open on fractured
hinges gave further aspects of abandonment.
</p>
<p>
“Anybody home?” called Walter, knocking on
the door, which swayed as though it wanted to
part company from the only hinge that held it
up. “Who’s in here? Hello inside!”
</p>
<p>
An echo was his only answer, though as they had
approached the place Paul had said he heard a
noise inside.
</p>
<p>
“Nobody home,” said Jack. “But this is at least
encouraging. We are getting ‘warm’ as they say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
in hunt the thimble. Let’s go around back. Maybe
they don’t use the front door.”
</p>
<p>
He started around a side path, followed by
Cora, Bess and Belle. The others straggled along
in the extreme rear. As the four in the lead turned
around an ell of the house, Cora uttered a cry and
pointed to two men who were running out of the
barn, not far off.
</p>
<p>
“Look, Jack!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
Jack stood still, quite taken by surprise, and
then Belle added:
</p>
<p>
“Why, Cora! I declare! One of those men
looks like one of the two who ran off with your
car!”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure about that, Belle?” demanded
Cora’s brother. “I don’t want to make a mistake.”
</p>
<p>
“I only saw their backs, of course,” explained
Belle, quite excited. “But that one on the left
looks like the one who took the wheel and steered
Cora’s auto away from the tea room. The coat is
just the same.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s pretty slim evidence on which to
chase after two strange men,” said Jack, “but here
goes. Come on, boys!” he called to Walter and
Paul. “Tally-ho!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the excitement?” asked Walter, as he
and Paul came running around the corner of the
house. “Dog after you, Jack?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, but we want to get after those two fellows.
See ’em?”
</p>
<p>
He pointed to the fleeing men.
</p>
<p>
“Who are they?” Paul queried.
</p>
<p>
“Belle thinks they’re the ones who took Cora’s
auto. It’s a rather slim identification, but we’ll
take a chance.”
</p>
<p>
“Yell at ’em,” suggested Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Good idea,” commented Jack. “I say there—you
two! Hold on a minute, we want to talk
to you!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
The two men, running away, never heeded nor
looked around. They ran on toward the woods,
the boys following, while the girls stood in a group
near the deserted house.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—REAL SURPRISES</h2>
<p>
“They aren’t going to stop,” observed Paul,
as he ran along beside Jack, watching the fleeing
men.
</p>
<p>
“No, and that makes me suspicious. Why
should those men run away just because we hailed
them? They don’t know us—that is, they haven’t
any reason to suppose we represent the girl whose
auto was taken. They have never seen us.”
</p>
<p>
“And they didn’t have a chance to get a good
look at Cora and the other girls, even supposing
they are the thieves who took the auto. According
to what Belle says, the men didn’t once look
around as they got into the car and drove off.
</p>
<p>
“Though they must have been hanging around
the Spinning Wheel for some time to have disposed
of the tickets,” said Walter. “They might
have seen the three girls, and again recognized
them as they came along now.”
</p>
<p>
“Possibly, but not probably,” declared Jack.
“They are either tramps, who have been sleeping
in the barn and think we own this place and have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
come to drive them out, or they are the auto
thieves, and naturally would run.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m inclined to the tramp theory,” declared
Paul. “They don’t look like knights of the roads,
though.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess we won’t have much further sight of
them,” commented Jack. “They’re almost at
the woods, and going strong.”
</p>
<p>
The men, indeed, were distancing the boys,
running fast with never a backward glance.
</p>
<p>
“Give ’em another hail!” cried Paul. “All together.
Tell ’em we only want to ask the way
from them. Now yell!”
</p>
<p>
The three lads united their voices in a loud
shout, but it had no effect, and, a moment later,
the two fleeing men plunged in among the trees.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we follow?” asked Paul, bringing his
run down to a walk.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly worth while,” commented Jack.
“We’d never find them in the woods.”
</p>
<p>
“Besides, we don’t want to leave the
girls alone,” added Paul.
</p>
<p>
“They are evidently determined not to be left
alone,” commented Jack with a smile. “There
they come after us.”
</p>
<p>
Cora and her chums were advancing across the
weed-grown field that lay between the house and
the woods, and over which the unsuccessful chase
had taken place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come on, we’ll give it up,” Walter said, as
he started back to meet the girls.
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t like to stay there all alone,” confessed
Cora.
</p>
<p>
“So we observe,” remarked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t get them?” questioned Cora.
</p>
<p>
“They wouldn’t even hesitate,” laughed Walter.
“Now for an inspection of the barn and
house.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you going in?” asked Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Why not? We may find some valuable evidence
that will put us on the track of Cora’s auto.
We may even find some hermit living in the house
who can put us on the right road. Let’s try the
barn first, though, as it was from there the men
came.”
</p>
<p>
The girls would not go in, but Walter and Jack
did, leaving Paul to stay with his sister and her
friends.
</p>
<p>
“Just keep your eyes open, Paul,” suggested
Jack. “Those fellows may come back while Wally
and I are inside.”
</p>
<p>
“Trust me,” observed Hazel’s brother.
</p>
<p>
But Jack and Walter found little to repay them
for their inspection of the barn. It was a dilapidated
building, almost tumbling down in fact,
and contained nothing save some wisps of hay
and straw. In one corner, though, was a pile of
old feed bags, arranged as a rude bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tramps been sleeping here,” observed Walter.
“Maybe those two men.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” agreed Jack.
</p>
<p>
But that was all they could gather, and they
came out.
</p>
<p>
“Now for the house,” suggested Walter.
</p>
<p>
“There’s some sort of lane over there, leading
to the cow shed,” said Cora. “Suppose you look
in that building.”
</p>
<p>
“Might as well,” agreed Jack. And it was in
approaching the smaller farm building through
the grass-grown lane that they made a discovery.
</p>
<p>
“There’s been an auto in here!” cried Paul,
as he saw some depressions in the ground. “An
auto has been driven in here and out again. I
can see two sets of wheel marks plainly.”
</p>
<p>
“Did one tire have a vulcanized patch on?”
Cora asked eagerly. “Mine had.”
</p>
<p>
“The marks aren’t plain enough to decide that,”
said Paul. “If there were dust or dirt here I
could tell, but grass and weeds don’t take a good
enough impression. The auto was put in the shed,
evidently.”
</p>
<p>
That proved to be a good guess, for the marks
of the big-tired wheels went up to the shed, which
was roomy enough for a car.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, one’s been in here!” cried Jack, as he
swung open the door. “See the tire marks on
the boards.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
“Was it mine?” asked Cora, eagerly. But
again the impression left was too faint to show
the vulcanized patch.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe some autoists, caught out in a storm,
put in here,” suggested Walter. “We mustn’t
build up too hopeful a theory on a slender basis
of fact.”
</p>
<p>
Traces of the automobile wheels were lost a
short distance down the lane, and none appeared
in the road which ran in front of the house—near
which the highway did not seem to be much
traveled.
</p>
<p>
“And now for the house itself,” said Jack.
“Come on, boys!”
</p>
<p>
“And girls, too!” exclaimed Cora. “We’re not
going to be left outside.”
</p>
<p>
They entered the old farmhouse, calling aloud
to ascertain if in some distant room there might
not be an occupant. But their voices were answered
only by echoes, with which their footsteps
mingled.
</p>
<p>
The house was typical of many another deserted
farm residence, of which there are many throughout
New England.
</p>
<p>
Windows were void of glass, doors hung uncertainly
on one hinge, moldy wall-paper drooped
down from the ceiling like unlovely Spanish moss,
and in many of the rooms the dampness and rain
had loosened the plaster which had fallen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
There were some old boxes, a broken chair or
two, and a moldy horsehair settee that, in bygone
days, must have graced the closed-up parlor,
opened only for marriages or deaths. Or,
perchance, on its glossy and slippery surface, lovers
had sat long ago.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh!” exclaimed Cora, with a little shudder.
“Come on out. It gives me the creeps in here.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I guess there’s nothing to gain by staying,”
Jack remarked. “Nobody home, and there’s
no use wasting time.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we were home,” said Belle.
</p>
<p>
“And I. At least, back in camp,” added her
sister.
</p>
<p>
As they went from the house they saw out in
the road a man driving a horse attached to a farm
wagon.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there’s something human at last!” cried
Cora. “Wait, please, we want to ask you something!”
she called impulsively.
</p>
<p>
But the man had already stopped of his own
accord, and a look of surprise came over his face
as he saw the party of young folks come out of
the abandoned house.
</p>
<p>
“Can you tell us the way to Mountain View?”
asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’m going that way myself,” the man answered.
“At least within a mile of it. Want
to ride?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do we!” exclaimed Bess with such a sigh
of relief that the others laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Pile in,” invited the farmer. “You aren’t
thinking of buying the old Mellish place; are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Is that what this is called?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Zeb Mellish used to own it, but he went
crazy and hung himself and nobody’s lived here
since; ’ceptin’ maybe tramps.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we saw two run away from the barn as
we came up,” stated Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” commented the farmer. “I’ll have
to speak to the constable about ’em. Too many
of us have been losin’ chickens lately. I suspected
it was tramps. Which way’d they go?”
</p>
<p>
The boys told; also narrating the details of their
little picnic and of their becoming lost.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that ain’t surprisin’, considerin’ how th’
cow paths in the woods twist to and fro,” commented
the farmer, who gave his name as Anthony
Wale. “So you’re from one of the bungalows
in the Mountain View property; eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Camp Surprise,” said Cora.
</p>
<p>
The man seemed to start, and looked sharply
at Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Camp Surprise; eh!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Know anything about it?” asked Walter. “We
have been expecting to be surprised, but haven’t
been, so far.”
</p>
<p>
“I know they tell queer stories about it,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
Mr. Ware, “but that’s all I do know. Maybe
the surprise party hasn’t started yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if it’s bound to happen, I wish it would
get over and done with,” said Cora. “It’s awfully
good of you to give us a lift this way.”
</p>
<p>
“Glad to do it,” said Mr. Ware. “There’s
room on the seat with me for two of you gals—at
least the thinnest ones—not meanin’ anything
against you,” and he looked at Bess, half smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m used to it now,” she declared. “You
can’t hurt my feelings. I’ll be glad to sit on one
of the boxes.”
</p>
<p>
The wagon contained several crates, and these
were utilized as seats, Hazel and Belle, as the
“thinnest gals,” sitting on the seat with Mr. Ware.
</p>
<p>
He drove them to within a half mile of their
own camp and they were soon at the bungalow,
just as Mr. and Mrs. Floyd were getting anxious
about their charges, and were talking of going
in search of them.
</p>
<p>
“What happened to you?” Mrs. Floyd inquired.
</p>
<p>
“Lost,” explained Jack, sententiously.
</p>
<p>
The adventures of the day were gone over again
at a joint supper, the boys being invited in by the
girls.
</p>
<p>
“You aren’t doing any housekeeping at all,”
Cora complained to Jack, afterward.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the use when you girls are such good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
cooks?” he asked with a laugh. “We’re thinking
of hiring a chef, anyhow, and then we’ll reciprocate
and give you a good feed.”
</p>
<p>
A trip down the mountain stream to where it
widened into a lake was the plan for the next day,
and an early start was made, Mrs. Floyd and her
husband stating that they had to go to town to
do some shopping, and would not be back before
night. They started before the young folks left,
and the girls locked their bungalow as they came
out.
</p>
<p>
Nothing of moment occurred on the trip to the
little lake, if the fact that Jack fell in up to his
knees, while trying to get some pond lilies for
Hazel be excepted.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I wonder if anything happened while
we were away?” asked Cora of Walter, as they
neared their camp on the return trip.
</p>
<p>
“Why do you suggest that?” he queried.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t just know. I have a funny sort
of feeling ‘in my bones,’ as mother used to say.”
</p>
<p>
Cora had the key and opened the door. The
boys were coming in, as they usually did, and stood
waiting for the girls to enter.
</p>
<p>
As Jack’s sister threw back the door she gave
one look in the living room, and exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“It’s here!”
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked Walter, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“The surprise! Look!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—WHERE’S MY LIGHT?</h2>
<p>
Crowding up behind Cora, the others peered
over her shoulders. The setting sun, streaming
in through the windows, revealed a strange sight
in the big living room. Several chairs were overturned,
a large couch that had been against the
wall was out in the middle of the floor, a table
that had been piled with magazines and books
was turned on its side, and turned upside down on
the overturned table was perched a chair, as
though children had been playing some simple
game, like stagecoach or steamboat, with the table
and chair to represent make-believe articles of
locomotion.
</p>
<p>
For a moment surprise and wonder held them
all dumb, then Jack burst out with:
</p>
<p>
“Say! who did this monkey-business, anyhow?”
</p>
<p>
“Monkey-business?” repeated Cora.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the surprise!” exclaimed Belle, and her
voice was not quite steady. “We’ve been expecting
this. The ghosts have paid one of their visits.
Oh dear!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be silly!” exclaimed Bess, who, perhaps
because her nerves were better protected, did
not give way to emotion so readily as did her thinner
sister. “Isn’t this just what we’ve been looking
for—and hoping for?”
</p>
<p>
“Hoping for?” asked Paul. “Well, I must say
it’s a queer sort of hope!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t mean that, exactly,” Bess went
on. “But we knew something like this was bound
to happen, and this is the first manifestation.”
</p>
<p>
“No, not exactly the first,” Cora said.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Bess. “Isn’t this
the first time anything has been upset in our bungalow?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but it isn’t the first manifestation,” Cora
went on. “Shall we tell, Belle?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” nodded the slim Robinson girl.
</p>
<p>
“Though how you can connect the queer noise
with what has taken place here I don’t see,” put
in Walter who had been looking curiously about
the upset room, which none of them had ventured
yet to enter.
</p>
<p>
“What! Does he know about it, too?” asked
Belle.
</p>
<p>
Cora nodded. “He heard it, and thought at
first it was thunder.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, what’s this all about?” demanded Jack.
“Are you hiding part of the secret from us, Sis?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, in a way—yes.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“That isn’t fair. If there’s a secret here we
ought to share it. And if you girls are going to
keep things to yourselves we fellows will pack
up and leave, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t dare desert us!” cried Belle. “I won’t
stay here a minute after the boys go; will you,
Cora?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I like to have them here, of course,”
answered Jack’s sister. “But if we talk that way
about them they’ll get an exaggerated idea of
their importance, and there’ll be no way of enforcing
discipline. So if they want to go let them, and
we’ll solve this mystery ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“I think we’re making a mountain out of a molehill,”
declared Walter. “I don’t see any great
mystery here. A few chairs and a table are upset.
It’s the most natural thing in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“Natural? How do you make that out?”
asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mrs. Floyd has been sweeping and dusting
in here, and she has moved the chairs about.
They always do it at our house. And say! some
days it’s as much as your life is worth to try to
navigate through the misplaced furniture. You
need a harbor pilot and a searchlight, to say nothing
of a chart and an automobile road map. That’s
all that’s happened here. Mrs. Floyd has been
doing a little house-cleaning.”
</p>
<p>
“So that’s your explanation of it; is it?” asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
Cora. “Then how do you account for the fact
that Mrs. Floyd and her husband have been away
all day?”
</p>
<p>
She pointed toward the road and the others saw
the two caretakers in Mr. Floyd’s light wagon
approaching the bungalow. They were returning
from their day’s shopping trip, as was evident by
the number of bundles in the vehicle.
</p>
<p>
“I think you’ll find that Mrs. Floyd hasn’t done
any house-cleaning to-day,” said Cora. “You
can’t account for the surprise that way.”
</p>
<p>
Cora was right, in so far as Mrs. Floyd was
concerned. The chaperon and her husband had
been away all day.
</p>
<p>
“What is it? What has happened? Is anything
the matter?” asked Mrs. Floyd, as she saw
the young people on the porch of the bungalow,
looking in at the open door. “Is any one hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“No, it’s just the surprise,” said Cora. “Is
that what has happened before, Mrs. Floyd?”
</p>
<p>
The caretaker looked inside, and caught her
breath sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Yes—yes,” she answered slowly. “This has
happened before, but never as bad as this. I mean
it never before was quite so upset. I—I can’t account
for it.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s them pesky tramps!” said Mr. Floyd.
“I’ll notify the constable again; that’s what I’ll
do!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you think it was tramps?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Who else could it be?” the caretaker demanded,
and neither Jack nor the others could
answer, though Walter asked:
</p>
<p>
“Well, if it were tramps, wouldn’t they steal
something if they had the chance they’ve had to-day?
Let’s take a look and see if anything is
missing.”
</p>
<p>
Then they went in, a bit gingerly at first, for
there is a queer, uncanny sort of feeling in coming
back to find the furniture upset in a strange
fashion. They all felt it, even joking Jack.
</p>
<p>
But, aside from the misplaced tables, chairs and
couch, nothing wrong was found. Nothing was
missing, as far as could be ascertained, and no
food had been taken from the pantry, though more
than once, Mrs. Floyd said, on former occasions
when the “surprise” had been manifested, the larder
showed signs of an unknown visitor.
</p>
<p>
“Now before we set things to rights,” suggested
Jack, “suppose we see if there are any clews.
Let’s go at this thing right. Look at each piece
of furniture and see if it has——”
</p>
<p>
“Any finger marks on? Is that what you mean,
Jack?” asked Paul.
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m not drawing it quite as fine as that.
I mean look around on the floor for bits of mud,
for any signs of foot prints—anything, in fact,
that would give us a line on who did this.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
“It seems to have been done deliberately, anyhow,”
observed Walter. “The chairs and other
things weren’t misplaced in a hurry. They took
their time. Why any one but a child would want
to pile that chair on the table is remarkable.”
</p>
<p>
“That very thing may indicate that it was just
some skylarking boys,” commented Jack.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Floyd shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“There aren’t any boys around here,” he said.
“Of course lads might come out from the village,
and break in to do this mischief, but it isn’t likely.
This is private land, and on several previous occasions
trespassers have been arrested, so the boys
don’t generally come here. Besides, they wouldn’t
have had a key to come in with.”
</p>
<p>
“Did they use a key to enter?” asked Paul.
</p>
<p>
“The door was locked when we got back,” replied
Cora, as if that settled it.
</p>
<p>
“And the window fastenings are still on,” reported
Jack, who made a quick inspection.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s a bit of mud near this one chair, as if
it had dropped from some one’s shoe,” Walter
said. “So the surprisers must have come in from
outside.”
</p>
<p>
“Where else would they come from?” Jack demanded.
“Did you think they were concealed in
the bungalow?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to think,” Walter answered
slowly. “It’s a queer mystery.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
“I hope it won’t cause you folks to leave,” said
Mrs. Floyd a bit anxiously. “We’d like you to
stay on.”
</p>
<p>
“And we will!” cried Cora. “We knew that
a surprise awaited us when we came here, and we
haven’t been disappointed. And, now that it has
come, we’re not going to turn cowards and run
away. We’ll get to the bottom of this mystery.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right!” cried Jack. “Who’s afraid?
You aren’t; are you, Hazel?”
</p>
<p>
“Not—not if——”
</p>
<p>
“Not if <em>I</em> stay! There, I knew it!” and Jack
puffed out his chest. “See what it is to have confidence
in a man. Now if the rest of you will act
as I do, we’ll soon——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I didn’t say that at all!” cried the blushing
Hazel. “I meant I would stay if the <em>rest</em> did.”
</p>
<p>
“Squelched!” murmured Jack in dejected tones.
“Never mind, I’ll lay this ghost yet. Now let’s
get things to rights, and then we’ll stay to supper
with you girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Hadn’t you better wait until you’re invited?”
asked Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do let them stay!” begged Belle. “I—I’m
a bit nervous over this.”
</p>
<p>
“Another manly protector needed,” murmured
Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Let us stay and we’ll help find the ghost,” suggested
Walter, and the girls were glad enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
agree, for, truth to tell, they were a bit upset, and
even Cora looked over her shoulder nervously as
she ascended the stairs.
</p>
<p>
“Well, they didn’t come up and disturb your
bedrooms this time,” said Mrs. Floyd, as she went
to the upper story with the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean to say they actually have upset
the things in the <em>bedrooms</em>?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes,” replied the caretaker. “Though
that hasn’t happened of late.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” sighed the slim girl. “I did hope
we would be safe from them up here.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they never come—that is, things never
happen—when any one is in the house,” Mrs.
Floyd hastened to add. “It’s always when the
place is left to itself.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the—er—well, call it ghost, for want
of a better name,” said Jack—“then the ghost
must keep watch to know when we go out.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Mrs. Floyd.
“It’s very annoying, and I do hope you will find
out what does it and stop it.”
</p>
<p>
“We will,” Jack declared. “I’m sure, after
all, we’ll find out that it is due to perfectly natural
causes.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I believe,” said Walter. “I wonder
if it could be an earthquake?”
</p>
<p>
“Earthquake?” echoed the others.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Walter went on. “You know that queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
noise which Cora, Belle and I seem to have heard
to the exclusion of you others? Well, that was a
sort of rumbling of the earth. It might have been
a slight shock, a reaction from a distant quake.
Such things have been known to happen. And if
there was one there might well be another. If
the bungalow shook hard enough the chairs might
have been upset as we found them.”
</p>
<p>
Jack shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Your theory won’t hold water,” he said. “If
there was a hard enough shock to knock over
chairs and tables, the dishes in the closets would
have been broken.”
</p>
<p>
“I think so, too,” declared Paul. “The earthquake
won’t account for it, Walter.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps not. But I can’t think what else it
could be.”
</p>
<p>
“A human agency, you may be sure of that,”
declared Cora. “I don’t believe in the supernatural.
This was done by human hands and, sooner
or later, we’ll discover by whom. Humans are
fallible and will make a mistake. We must watch
for that mistake.”
</p>
<p>
They righted the furniture and talking of the
matter seemed to make it lose some of its mysteriousness.
The boys stayed to supper and until
late in the evening. Jack offered to remain all
night, and sleep on the couch downstairs, but
Cora would not hear of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be all right,” she declared. “We can
call you on the telephone if we want you. Besides,
Mr. Floyd is going to leave open the door
leading to his quarters, and he can hear if we call.
We’ll be all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, ring us up if you find the chairs doing
a fox trot or hesitation waltz in the middle of the
night,” suggested Walter.
</p>
<p>
The girls went upstairs together, casting quick,
nervous glances over their shoulders as they ascended.
They locked their hall doors as soon as
they were inside. But as the four chambers communicated,
it was as if they were in one large
apartment.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear!” exclaimed Cora, as she was taking
down her hair. “I’ve forgotten it.”
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked Bess, who was taking off her
shoes.
</p>
<p>
“My flashlight,” Cora answered. “I left it on
the table in the living room. I meant to bring it
up, for I like to see what time it is if I awaken in
the night.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go down with you if you want to get it,”
offered Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you. I’ll do without it. I dare say
I shan’t need it.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s burn a light all night,” proposed Belle.
</p>
<p>
And no one called her silly. So the lamp was
left aglow, turned down a little.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
Contrary, at least to some expectations, the
night passed peacefully. There was no disturbance,
and the girls awoke refreshed and with only
a little feeling of uneasiness as to what might happen
in the future.
</p>
<p>
But when Cora went downstairs, and began
looking among the things on the table in the living
room, another manifestation of the queer happenings
was in evidence.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s my light?” she demanded. “I left
my flashlight here last night, and now it’s gone.
Did any one take it?”
</p>
<p>
No one had, the boys and girls denying all
knowledge. Nor had Mr. or Mrs. Floyd removed
it, and Cora was positive she had left it
on the table. She recalled her remarks about it
the night previous.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s gone,” she said. “Another one of
the mysteries.”
</p>
<p>
“You seem to be singled out,” observed Walter.
“First it’s your auto, and now your light.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think the two cases have any connection?”
asked Cora.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—MORE HAPPENINGS</h2>
<p>
Walter considered the matter rather judicially
before answering. Then he gave as his decision:
</p>
<p>
“No, I can’t say that I do. It is, perhaps, only a
coincidence that your automobile and your flashlight
should have been taken. I dare say that had
it been a light belonging to any one else it would
have disappeared just the same.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean that they—the mysterious They—would
have taken the light, no matter to whom it
belonged?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly! It was a case of wanting a light and
taking it.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did they get in to take it?” asked Paul.
“There’s no sign of anything having been broken;
is there—no doors or windows?”
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t look,” Cora said.
</p>
<p>
“Then that’s what we’d better do,” Jack suggested.
</p>
<p>
But an examination did not show that any means
had been used to force a passage from without.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
The windows were provided with screens which
fastened from within in such a way that force
would have to be exerted to slip them. And this
had not been done. Nor had the door been tampered
with.
</p>
<p>
“There’s only one way to account for it,” said
Walter, “and that is on the theory that the Surprisers,
Ghosts, They—whatever you choose to
call them—used skeleton keys. And they must
be professional burglars, or they would have made
noise enough to have aroused you girls. You
didn’t hear anything; did you?”
</p>
<p>
Not one had heard a sound.
</p>
<p>
“But if they were professional thieves wouldn’t
they have taken something else besides a flashlight?”
asked Jack. “There’s plenty of other
things they might have picked up.”
</p>
<p>
This was true enough, for the girls had left
many of their more or less valuable belongings
downstairs. But none of them had been taken.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps they just needed Cora’s light to help
them in some of their other surprise visits,” suggested
Bess. “Isn’t it most delightfully mystifying?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that I find it especially so,” retorted
Belle, with a quick glance over her shoulder.
“It’s getting on my nerves.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can quit and go away when you want
to,” suggested her sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never!” cried Cora. “We’re not going to desert
in the face of danger; are we, Belle?”
</p>
<p>
The slim twin hesitated a moment, and then answered,
but not very decidedly:
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew you wouldn’t,” said Jack’s sister. “We
Motor Girls aren’t cowards.”
</p>
<p>
“We give you credit for that,” declared Walter.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the brave front of Cora and her
chums, the happenings at Camp Surprise were
getting on their nerves. The boys, true to their
promise, began to plan to do their own cooking;
but in view of the fact that the oftener they were
in the girls’ bungalow the better Cora and her
chums liked it, it was decided to have the boys
take all their meals with the girls. Jack, Walter
and Paul would merely sleep in the smaller building,
where they were in close call by means of the
telephone.
</p>
<p>
For the next two days nothing happened. No
more articles were missed, and the furniture remained
where it was put. Then came two or
three days when our friends were off on long picnics,
remaining all day, leaving Mr. and Mrs.
Floyd in charge. Nor on these occasions did anything
happen. The bungalow was as peaceful
when they returned as when they left.
</p>
<p>
“I guess it’s all over,” said Cora, when nearly a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
week had passed, and there had been no more
manifestations. “It was a flashlight they were
looking for all the while, and, now that they have
it, they are satisfied.”
</p>
<p>
“It might be,” admitted Belle. “I hope it is.”
</p>
<p>
There were happy days in the mountains. Sometimes
the young folks would wander far afield or
through the woods, taking their lunches and staying
all day. Again they would go berrying or fishing.
And they did not get lost again, for the boys
became familiar with the lay of the land. Cora,
too, as well as Belle and Bess, got her bearings,
and knew how to find the back paths.
</p>
<p>
Fishing formed a pastime that all enjoyed, for
the streams and ponds in Mountain View were
private property, and had not been depleted of
their finny inhabitants. So fish formed many a
dainty dish for the table.
</p>
<p>
It was one day when Mr. Floyd had gone in
to town, and Mrs. Floyd had departed to one
of the more distant bungalows to get it in readiness
for occupancy, that Cora and her friends again
went on a little trip to the small lake which once
before they had visited.
</p>
<p>
“And make sure everything is well locked,”
Belle advised, as they started away, boys and girls
together.
</p>
<p>
Windows and doors were seen to, though no
one had more than a faint suspicion that any unbidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
visitors would call. They got back rather
early in the afternoon, for a thunder shower was
threatening, and as Jack opened the door and
looked in the living room, he called out:
</p>
<p>
“All serene. They haven’t been here this
time.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s good,” said Belle. “I guess we’ve
broken the hoodoo.”
</p>
<p>
But when Cora and Hazel went upstairs there
came simultaneous cries of surprise from them.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Cora!” cried Hazel. “Look at my room!”
</p>
<p>
“And look at mine!” Cora added.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Jack from below.
</p>
<p>
“Everything!” answered his sister. “They’ve
been up here, Jack!”
</p>
<p>
“Who?”
</p>
<p>
“The Surprise, of course. Our rooms are all
upset.”
</p>
<p>
“Is anything taken?” asked Jack, who, with the
others, came up to look at the strange evidences
left by the mysterious visitors.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t tell yet,” said Cora. “Oh dear! what
does it all mean?”
</p>
<p>
No one answered for a moment, but Belle and
Bess looked half-fearfully about, as though even
then they might be standing in the presence of some
unseen creature.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—A DANCING LIGHT</h2>
<p>
“This is getting to be the limit of patience!”
exclaimed Jack a bit wrathfully, as he looked at
the disordered rooms. “Why can’t we do something?”
</p>
<p>
“We could, if we knew what to do,” said Walter.
“But you can’t fight nothing with something.”
</p>
<p>
“It is very intangible,” said Cora. “Oh, all
my pretty things scattered about!”
</p>
<p>
“Look and see if anything is taken,” suggested
Paul. “If we can find out what is missing—I
mean the character of the things—we can get a
better line on who might have taken them. So far,
the flashlight indicates regular burglars.”
</p>
<p>
For a time the girls were so put out, and so
nervous over what had happened, that they could
not ascertain what, if anything, was missing.
</p>
<p>
Then Cora began to reckon up her belongings,
and found that a number of articles had been
taken. Hazel found the same misfortune had
visited her.
</p>
<p>
“There are lots of my things gone,” said Cora.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked Walter, producing pencil and
paper. “Let’s get at this systematically.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, there are lots of things you—you
wouldn’t understand about,” said Cora, blushing
slightly.
</p>
<p>
“That’s true enough,” Walter admitted with a
smile. “You are not on the witness stand, so you
needn’t mention face powder, nose rings——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I like that!” cried Cora. “As if we used
face powder!”
</p>
<p>
“Just for that he will have to eat at the second
table,” pronounced Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” challenged Jack, laughing. “Get
down to business. What sort of things are missing,
Cora?”
</p>
<p>
“Girls’ things, of course,” said his sister. “We
didn’t have much else up here.”
</p>
<p>
And that, it developed, was what was missing.
Trinkets, some toilet articles, including a silver-mounted
set belonging to Cora which Jack had
given her the previous Christmas, were gone.
Hazel lost a silver-backed mirror and a box full
of bright ribbons.
</p>
<p>
“Well, this beats me!” said Walter with a puzzled
air, as he looked at the list he had made.
“They took some things they may possibly dispose
of at a pawnshop, but why grown men burglars
should want hair ribbons, or neck ribbons, or whatever
ribbons they are, gets me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think they were men?” asked
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Who else would it be?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we first had a theory that the upsetting
might have been done by boys,” said Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that theory would fit, under certain circumstances,”
agreed Walter. “So would the taking
of the flashlight. Almost any boy would have
been glad to get that. But what boy would take
a lot of pretty ribbons, even though he were
enough of a criminal to know that he might be
able to dispose of the silver-mounted toilet articles?
It doesn’t jibe.”
</p>
<p>
In the main, they were forced to agree with
Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Well, the fact remains that we have had another
visit from the unknowns,” concluded Walter,
“and what are we going to do about it?”
</p>
<p>
For a moment no one knew what to say. And
then, as brains were busy with the mystery, several
schemes were offered.
</p>
<p>
“Put some animal traps about and catch the intruders,”
said Jack.
</p>
<p>
“One of us stay and watch, while the others go
away,” was Paul’s contribution.
</p>
<p>
“Sprinkle talcum powder on the floor, and then
we can track them by the marks,” offered Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Not such a bad idea,” declared Jack, as the
others laughed. “It has been known to work.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
“Call in the police,” came from Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” scoffed Cora. “If they couldn’t get
back my automobile they can’t find mysterious
thieves who enter through locked doors or windows,
and vanish into thin air with their ill-gotten
gains.”
</p>
<p>
“Let—let’s go home!” faltered Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” cried Cora. “We’ll stick it out.
It is just getting interesting.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right,” announced Belle, “but suppose—suppose
they come in the night, when we’re
asleep, and take one of us?”
</p>
<p>
“Let them begin on Bess,” suggested Jack, with
a laugh. “No offense, of course, fair one,” and he
bowed, “but you know you could give a good account
of yourself if some one did try to walk off
with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t dare suggest such a thing!” cried the
plump twin. “I’d never go to sleep if I thought
they’d come at night.”
</p>
<p>
“They do seem to confine their visits to daytime,
and to the periods when we are away,” said Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Which makes it look, more than ever, as if
they watched the bungalow and knew just when
to take advantage of our absence,” commented
Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t say that!” begged Belle. “Just
think—they—they may be watching now!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if they are let’s go and see if we can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
rout them out,” suggested Jack. “There aren’t
many places of concealment about the bungalow.”
</p>
<p>
While the other girls helped Cora and Hazel
put to rights the upset rooms, the boys made a
thorough search outside. There did not seem to
be any place where the mysterious persons might
conceal themselves in order to spy on the bungalow.
There were trees all about, but the underbrush
had been cut away, and there was small
chance for concealment. The boys also started to
make an inspection about their own bungalow,
but this was cut short by a shower that came up.
</p>
<p>
“Well, so far, we are just about where we
started,” said Jack, as he and his two chums were
eating supper with the girls that night. “We
haven’t found out anything.”
</p>
<p>
“But we will!” declared Cora. “I’m not going
to be beaten this way. We’ll organize a campaign.”
</p>
<p>
They talked to this end, making a tentative
plan that the next time they went off on a trip,
some member of the party would be left behind
in concealment in the bungalow, to see, if possible,
who the visitor or visitors were.
</p>
<p>
“And if that doesn’t work we’ll try something
else,” said Walter.
</p>
<p>
It was evident, though, that after the first few
trials the new plan was not going to work. Though
the boys took turns in remaining in concealment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
while the others went away, not a sound or sign
of disturbance was noted. No furniture was misplaced,
and nothing was taken.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to have a new scheme,” said Cora.
“Let’s talk to Mr. and Mrs. Floyd about it. Maybe
they can suggest something.”
</p>
<p>
But the caretaker and his wife had nothing to
offer. They were as much worried and disturbed
by the queer happenings as were the girls and boys.
And though they were generous and kindly souls,
they were not quick thinkers, and had little imagination.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just spirits,” said Mrs. Floyd. “Spirits
come and go.”
</p>
<p>
“There aren’t any such things,” declared Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s lightning,” suggested Mr. Floyd.
“We have pretty heavy thunderstorms up here.”
</p>
<p>
“Lightning can’t move furniture, nor carry off
looking glasses and hair ribbons,” Cora went
on.
</p>
<p>
“Well, once lightning struck Jim Dobson’s
cabin,” the caretaker said, “and knocked all his
pots and pans off the stove, and burned a hole
right through his clock.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s within the bounds of possibility,” admitted
Jack.
</p>
<p>
“It’s boys!” decided Walter. “You’ll find that
some youngsters are up to these tricks, and they’re
cute enough to cover up their tracks.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s it,” said Paul. “They’re too cute.
They don’t leave any tracks. How they get in
and out again, without leaving a clew or a mark
is more than I can see.” For an examination of
the place after the losses suffered by Cora and
Hazel had disclosed no apparent means of egress
or ingress.
</p>
<p>
One evening when the girls had gone over to the
boys’ bungalow to sit and talk, Cora, who had
gone to the end of the porch, whence a view could
be had of the other building, uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a light in our bungalow!” she called.
“Did we leave one burning?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” answered Belle. “I put it out, as I was
afraid of fire.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, one’s there now. See how it dances
about!”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, a light could be observed, dancing up
and down, flashing first from one window and then
from another.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Mr. or Mrs. Floyd,” said Jack.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve gone to the village,” Paul said. “I
saw them go.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the mysterious visitors!” cried Walter.
“They’re using Cora’s flashlight! Come on, boys,
this time we have them!”
</p>
<p>
He ran toward the bungalow, followed by the
others.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—A MOUNTAIN CAVE</h2>
<p>
Advancing rapidly toward the girls’ bungalow,
where so many strange happenings had occurred,
and where even now the strange light was flashing,
first at one window, then at another, Cora
and her chums—boys and girls—speculated on
what could be the cause.
</p>
<p>
“Let the boys go first,” cautioned Belle. “We
don’t know what it might be.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right! Wish the danger on to us!”
commented Jack. “But we’re not afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s only those mischievous boys,” declared
Paul. “We’ll catch ’em in the very act now.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did the little rascals get in without
our seeing them?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“We weren’t watching the bungalow very
closely,” said Paul. “They could easily have
slipped in from the back, around on the forest
side. They watched their chance.”
</p>
<p>
“But what’s their game?” asked Jack, as they
crossed the rustic bridge on the run, their footsteps
echoing dully on the boards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“Go easy!” cautioned Walter. “Don’t make
so much noise, or we’ll scare them away before
we have a chance to catch them.”
</p>
<p>
“They can’t hear us above the noise of the
waterfall,” declared Jack. “But what’s their
game? That’s what I want to know. Why are
they flashing that light about so?”
</p>
<p>
“There must be two or three of them with
lights,” said Cora. “For first I noticed it up in
the window of my room, and a second later, certainly
in less time than any human boy could make
the trip downstairs, the light showed from a window
in the living room.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably there are three or four of the little
rascals,” said Walter. “Come on now, we’re almost
there.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait here, girls,” suggested Cora. “Let the
boys go ahead, though after they catch these mischief-makers
I’ll feel like giving them a good shaking
myself.”
</p>
<p>
Walter, Paul and Jack advanced toward the
bungalow. They went softly up on the porch,
looking sharply for a sign of the light.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to have gone out,” commented Jack in
a whisper.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. They must have heard us and switched
it off.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably they’ve skipped out, too, worse
luck!” came from Paul.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, as they listened, they could hear no
sound from the bungalow, at the door of which
they now stood. All was silent and dark within.
</p>
<p>
“Got a match?” Walter asked.
</p>
<p>
“Take my flashlight,” returned Jack. “It’s
stronger than Cora’s.”
</p>
<p>
The brilliant white beam of light from the electric
flash which Jack handed to Walter illuminated
the interior of the living room. And at the sight
which met the gaze of the boys, they could not
restrain murmurs of astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“Well, would you look at that!”
</p>
<p>
“Same thing over again!”
</p>
<p>
“And right under our noses too! They never
made a sound!”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” called Cora, from where she
and her chums stood waiting. “Did you catch
them?”
</p>
<p>
“Haven’t yet,” answered Walter, playing the
light about the room. “But the furniture is all
upset, just as it was the other day, only more
so. Come on up, girls. I guess there’s no danger.
The boys have probably skipped out, though
we may get them yet. Jack, you go around to the
side door. Paul, you cover the back. I’ll take a
run through the bungalow and stir them up.”
</p>
<p>
Pausing to light a lamp in the living room, Walter
ran up the stairs to the apartments of the girls,
while Jack and Paul formed a guard outside the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
bungalow. The girls still remained a little distance
away, awaiting developments.
</p>
<p>
But there were none—at least inside the bungalow.
Walter came down stairs to report that
no one was up there.
</p>
<p>
“But are things upset in our rooms?” asked
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“And is anything taken?” Hazel questioned.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t stop to look,” confessed Walter. “I
was just trying to drive out intruders.”
</p>
<p>
“None came out the door I was watching,” declared
Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Nor where I was,” said Paul.
</p>
<p>
“How in the world did they get away
so quickly?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
No one could answer him and they all turned
their attention to the living room.
</p>
<p>
As Walter had said, it was more upset than on
the other occasion. Every chair in the big apartment
had been overturned, and in some cases two
were jammed together, the legs interwoven. On
a table two chairs had been piled, while the couch
was turned completely upside down, and a stool
perched on top of it, a sofa cushion surmounting
that.
</p>
<p>
Other sofa cushions were tossed about the room,
as though the intruders had been having a pillow
fight, and in fact the whole room had that appearance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“But nothing seems to have been taken,” said
Cora, after a look around, when the furniture
had been put to rights.
</p>
<p>
“Better not be too sure,” cautioned Walter.
“Wait until you take a look upstairs. I only
glanced around.”
</p>
<p>
“How in the world could they do all this without
making a noise?” asked Paul. “It seems to
have been done in a hurry, and boys are rather
clumsy—I know I was. They ought, by rights,
to have stumbled all over themselves, doing this
by the light of only a pocket flash. And yet we
heard no racket as we ran up. It was all quiet.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s one queer part of it,” admitted Walter.
“It almost makes one believe in——”
</p>
<p>
“Ghosts! Go on and say it,” challenged Cora.
“You can’t scare us.”
</p>
<p>
“Any more than we are frightened now,” said
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Are you frightened?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“A little,” she confessed. “Wouldn’t you be—if
you were I?”
</p>
<p>
“I might be,” he admitted. “But we’ll get at
the bottom of this for you, and catch those youngsters.”
</p>
<p>
“If we only could be sure they were boys,”
Belle murmured.
</p>
<p>
“Who else could it be?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Ask us something easier,” suggested Paul.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
“Go ahead upstairs, girls, and see if anything is
missing.”
</p>
<p>
This advice was acted upon, and when the place
was aglow with lights Cora and her chums took
“an account of stock,” as Jack said.
</p>
<p>
“Well, any of your ‘war paint’ missing?” he
demanded of his sister when she came down.
</p>
<p>
“Only a few little trinkets,” she said, “ribbons
and things like that. If it were not impossible, I
should say girls had a hand in this.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t impossible,” declared Walter. “Girls
can do almost anything nowadays. But it isn’t
likely. Some boys are just as fond of bright things
as are girls, and probably these youngsters hope to
make neckties of your ribbons.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what are we going to do about it?”
asked Jack, when they had sat discussing the curious
happening for some time.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>can</em> we do?” Walter demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I know one thing <em>I</em> am going to do,” declared,
Belle, “and that is I’m going home in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
“No!” cried Cora.
</p>
<p>
“I am if this mystery isn’t cleared up. It’s
getting on my nerves horribly,” and she gave a
quick glance over her shoulder as a slight noise
sounded.
</p>
<p>
“I did that,” confessed Hazel, who had dropped
a book.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t do it again, my dear,” begged Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Now look here!” cried Cora, “this won’t do.
We’re going to stick it out. We agreed on that,
you know. We’re going to find out what this mystery
is.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I say!” came from Bess.
</p>
<p>
“I’m willing to stay,” declared Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, since I seem to be in the minority I’ll
have to give in,” sighed Belle. “I’ll stay if you
all do, but I really think some one ought to be in
this bungalow with us—one of the boys or——”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay here,” came from Jack, Walter, and
Paul in a trio.
</p>
<p>
But when Mr. and Mrs. Floyd returned from
town, and heard of the strange happenings, they
offered to sleep in a small room opening off the
living apartment.
</p>
<p>
The night, however, passed without incident,
though none of the girls slept well. Morning
seemed to quiet the frayed nerves, and the happenings
of the night before did not seem so mysterious
in the glare of the golden sun.
</p>
<p>
The season for berries was at its height now,
and as many varieties grew on the mountainside
the young campers organized another expedition
one day, about a week after the disturbance in
which the light figured. Mrs. Floyd promised
to bake the pies if the boys and girls gathered the
berries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
They planned for an all day stay, taking their
lunch, and early in the afternoon all berry baskets
were filled. Then, as there were some ominous-looking
clouds in the west, they decided to
start for the bungalows.
</p>
<p>
They were about half a mile from Camp Surprise,
on a new short cut which Mr. Floyd had
mentioned, when Cora, who was hurrying along
in the lead, slipped on a slight declivity and, to
save herself from falling, grasped a bush.
</p>
<p>
The bush, however, offered little hold, for it
came away in her hand, and Cora slid on, until
she brought up on a level place. She looked back,
to join the others in the laugh at her slight mishap,
when her eyes noted the place from which the
bush had pulled away.
</p>
<p>
“Why look! Look here!” she called to the others.
“Here’s a regular cave!”
</p>
<p>
“A cave?” echoed Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. There’s a big hole which I’d never have
seen only the bush became uprooted. Come here!”
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” cried Jack. “Let’s see where this
leads to. It may have something to do with the
mystery.”
</p>
<p>
“What mystery?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“What mystery? The mystery of Camp Surprise!
Maybe the boys hide in this cave. Come
on!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—THE TREMBLING NOISE</h2>
<p>
Jack, Walter, and Paul tore away more of the
bushes screening the mouth of the natural cave.
As they removed the leafy branches the black hole
was seen to be of large size, fully high enough to
permit even a tall man to enter without stooping,
and wide enough to enable three to walk abreast.
</p>
<p>
“This is some cave!” exclaimed Jack. “I wonder
Mr. Floyd never told us about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he didn’t know,” suggested Cora. “I
wouldn’t have seen it, and I was within a few feet
of it, if I hadn’t slipped and pulled away the
bush.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll soon see if it amounts to anything,”
declared Paul, setting down the pail of berries
he was carrying.
</p>
<p>
“Are you girls coming in with us?” asked Walter,
looking at Cora and her chums who had not
advanced.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. Shall we?” asked Hazel, looking
at her brother.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to stay here,” said Cora. “Besides,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
something might happen to the boys. But
how are you going to explore the cave in the dark?
And it is as dark as a bottle of ink in there. Have
any of you your flashlights?”
</p>
<p>
“We can make a torch of wood,” said Jack,
when it developed that none of them had one of
the pocket electric lights.
</p>
<p>
But just as Jack and the others were about to
enter the cave the mutterings of thunder which
had been increasing, culminated in such a clap that
the girls, involuntarily placed their hands over
their ears.
</p>
<p>
“Come on! Run for the bungalow!” cried
Cora. “Else we’ll be caught in a terrible storm!
It’s starting to rain now.”
</p>
<p>
Some hot drops hissed down, the prelude to an
almost tropical fury of the elements it seemed.
</p>
<p>
“We can go into the cave,” suggested Paul.
</p>
<p>
“No!” cried his sister. “You shan’t go in there
with this storm coming up. The cave will keep.
Come on, let’s run!”
</p>
<p>
She darted off down the side of the mountain,
the other girls following. The boys hesitated a
moment, and then, not wishing to desert the girls,
even though the latter ran first, they followed.
</p>
<p>
“We can come back to the cave to-morrow,”
said Walter. “It won’t run away. And to explore
it well we ought to have the electric lights.
Come on.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
Paul and Jack followed him, and they all
reached the girls’ bungalow just as the deluge of
rain came down.
</p>
<p>
For an hour or more the storm raged, blinding
lightning and deafening thunder succeeding one
another. But the bungalow was snug and safe,
though once, when a tree was struck not far away,
the girls screamed in terror.
</p>
<p>
That crash, however, seemed to be the culmination
of the outburst, for from then on the rain began
to slacken, and the thunder died away in muttered
rumblings and the lightning became paler
and paler until it was only a faint, shimmering
light.
</p>
<p>
Then the dark sky cleared and the sun came
out, shining through the storm-riven clouds and
warming the ground and trees which were dripping
from the vigorous bath.
</p>
<p>
“We got home just in time,” commented Cora,
as they looked out on the ceasing storm. “A little
longer on the mountain and we would have
been drenched.”
</p>
<p>
“That cave was a find,” commented Jack. “I
want to see what’s in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably nothing more than a hole in the side
of the mountain,” commented Bess.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t be too sure of that,” voiced Walter.
“I wonder if Mr. Floyd knows anything about
it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
It developed that the caretaker did not, though
he said there were several small mountain caves
in that section, and this was probably one of them
that he had not chanced upon.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think smugglers or pirates might have
used it?” asked Hazel, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly pirates,” commented Jack. “Too far
from the water. But smugglers might have done
so. We’re not so far from the Canadian line.”
</p>
<p>
“All bosh!” declared Paul. “It’s probably a
garage dating from the stone age when the early
inhabitants used the dinosaur as a jitney!”
</p>
<p>
They all laughed at his conceit and talked further
of the cave and what they might find in it
when they explored it the next day.
</p>
<p>
Whether it was the severe thunderstorm, or
whether it was the culmination of the happenings
of the past few weeks was not made clear, but it
was certain that the girls, even Cora, were more
nervous than they had been at any time yet.
</p>
<p>
“I—I wish we didn’t have to stay here to-night,”
said Belle when supper was over, and
they sat out on the porch, gazing into the fast-gathering
darkness.
</p>
<p>
“Why?” asked Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Because I—I’m afraid. Come now, aren’t
you?” she challenged.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I can’t say I like all the mysterious happenings,”
Cora admitted. “And now that we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
know there is a cave near us—more than one perhaps—and
that we don’t know who—or what—may
be in them, why, I can’t say it is the most
pleasant vacation we have experienced.”
</p>
<p>
“This bungalow gives me the creeps!” complained
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Why not take ours?” suggested Walter. “It’s
large enough for you to sleep in, and we’ll take
this one. Come on, what do you say?”
</p>
<p>
“No, not to-night anyhow,” decided Cora.
“We’ll keep to our agreement and stay here. Mrs.
Floyd will be here with us.”
</p>
<p>
“And not Mr. Floyd?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“No, not until later. He has to go to some
town meeting I believe, and will come in around
midnight. But nothing has happened in the last
few days—not even a noise.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard noises,” confessed Belle.
</p>
<p>
“What sort?” Jack inquired.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sort of rumbling, trembling noises, and
they seemed to be away down under the ground.
I heard one yesterday, when I came back to get
my veil after the others had gone out. It scared
me,” Belle added.
</p>
<p>
“I think the waterfall causes those rumbling
noises,” said Walter. “We’ll have to investigate
that to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
The boys went to their own bungalow, and Mrs.
Floyd came in to occupy the small temporary bedroom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
Her husband would be in later, she explained,
confirming Cora’s information in that respect.
The thunderstorm had cooled the rather
oppressive air and there was a refreshing breeze
blowing as the girls went up to their bedrooms.
</p>
<p>
Just who awakened first, it would be hard to
say. Probably it was Belle, as she was the lightest
sleeper. Cora heard her calling, and at the same
time she was aware of another disturbance.
</p>
<p>
“Do you hear it?” asked Belle from her room.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Cora answered. At the same time she
could hear Bess and Hazel getting up.
</p>
<p>
The whole bungalow seemed filled with a roaring,
trembling noise, and there was a slight vibration
of the building.
</p>
<p>
“What is it? Oh, what is it?” cried Belle, in
hysterical tones.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” answered Cora. “But I’m going
to find out.”
</p>
<p>
“How?”
</p>
<p>
“By calling the boys. Mrs. Floyd, are you
awake?” Cora demanded, going to the head of
the stairs.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. That noise awoke me.”
</p>
<p>
“Is Mr. Floyd home?”
</p>
<p>
“Not yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’m going to telephone for the boys!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—THE SECRET PASSAGE</h2>
<p>
Hastily donning robes and slippers, the girls
gathered about Cora as she rang the electric bell
which had been arranged to summon the boys in
the other bungalow to the toy telephone. Meanwhile,
Mrs. Floyd had arisen and dressed to let
in the boys. The rumbling, trembling noise had
stopped.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, why don’t they answer?” cried Cora, impatiently
pushing the electric bell button again
and again.
</p>
<p>
Then, through the toy receiver came a faint
voice.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! Hello, there! Is that you, girls?
What is the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“This you, Jack?” Cora asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Come over as fast as you can! Hurry!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t stop to question! Hurry over!” Cora
begged. “It’s that terrible noise again. Can’t
you hear it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” answered Jack. “But we’ll be right over.
Come on, fellows!” Cora heard him call to Walter
and Paul, as he left the telephone. “The
girls are scared.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess he’d be too, if he heard that noise,”
Cora said. “Did you all hear it?” and she appealed
to her chums.
</p>
<p>
“I did,” affirmed Hazel. “It sounded like distant
thunder.”
</p>
<p>
“Could it have been?” asked Mrs. Floyd, who
had joined the girls.
</p>
<p>
“The stars are shining,” reported Belle, looking
from a window, shading her eyes with her
hands from the light in the room. They had
partly dressed and gone down to the living room.
There they listened and waited both for a recurrence
of the noise and for the approach of the
boys.
</p>
<p>
The latter made their presence known first,
fairly running along the graveled way that led
from their bungalow, over the rustic bridge, to
the girls’ abiding place.
</p>
<p>
“What’s all the racket about?” demanded Jack,
as he and his two chums entered, rather breathless
from their run and their hurry in dressing, the
hurry showing itself in the absence of collars and
ties.
</p>
<p>
“It’s that noise,” said Cora, her voice trembling
slightly. “We heard it again, Jack.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
“Was it so scary?” demanded Paul, looking at
his sister.
</p>
<p>
“It certainly was—too scary for words!” answered
Belle. “I’m not going to pass another
night in Camp Surprise!”
</p>
<p>
“It <em>has</em> been a surprise with a vengeance,” declared
Bess. “Boys, can’t you do something?”
she appealed.
</p>
<p>
“What’s to be done?” asked Jack. “We’ll
have to wait until we hear the noise again, and
then we can tell from which direction it comes.
Suppose, while we’re waiting, you girls just tell
us what you heard.”
</p>
<p>
They had all heard something different, it developed.
At least, they all had a different impression
of the noise.
</p>
<p>
Cora described it as a “trembling roar.”
</p>
<p>
Bess said it was a rumble, as though a heavy
wagon had passed in front of the bungalow.
</p>
<p>
Belle said it reminded her of a deep, heavy
sound, such as she had once heard in a blast furnace.
</p>
<p>
It was reserved for Hazel to describe accurately
the noise, though none of them knew her
description was correct until afterward.
</p>
<p>
“It was like a factory or machine shop next
door,” said Paul’s sister. “It seemed to shake
the bungalow as though heavy machinery were
working.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
“It must be the waterfall,” decided Jack. “Only
a large body of water, tumbling down into some
chasm, could make a noise like that. There’s no
machinery around here. Besides, the waterfall is
bigger than ever now, on account of the rain. It
must be that.”
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t!” declared Cora, though when
pressed for reasons to bolster up her denial she
could give none. “It wasn’t that sort of noise at
all,” she affirmed. “It was more like——”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Belle so suddenly that
the other girls jumped nervously.
</p>
<p>
It was the sound of a footstep on the porch, a
firm, unhesitating footstep.
</p>
<p>
“I expect that’s my husband,” said Mrs. Floyd.
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Floyd, and he was, greatly surprised
to see the “whole family up,” as he expressed
it.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” he asked, looking around
on the circle of rather startled faces, ending with
his wife’s. “Did you sit up to see how late I got
in? Strictly business, young ladies and gentlemen,”
he went on, smiling at them. “The committee
had considerable to transact, and I had to
stay.”
</p>
<p>
“This is a sort of surprise party,” Cora told
him. “Camp Surprise is living up to its name,”
and she went on to tell about the noise, the others
adding bits here and there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw now! That’s queer!” commented Mr.
Floyd. “I have heard them rumblings myself,
but I laid ’em to the waterfall. It’s a curious cataract
at times.”
</p>
<p>
“This noise,” began Cora, “isn’t like anything
I ever——”
</p>
<p>
She paused midway in the sentence, and a
strange look grew and spread over her face, as it
did over the faces of the others.
</p>
<p>
“There it is now,” whispered Bess. “That—that
noise!”
</p>
<p>
They all heard it, a dull, rumbling roar that
made the bungalow tremble as when a heavy wind
blows and vibrates the timbers of a house.
</p>
<p>
“So that’s what it is!” exclaimed Jack. “This
is my first experience.”
</p>
<p>
“I heard it once, though distantly,” said Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” cautioned Cora.
</p>
<p>
The noise seemed to increase.
</p>
<p>
“Say, that is curious!” commented Mr. Floyd.
“I never noticed that before. Where does it come
from?”
</p>
<p>
Hardly had he spoken than the rumbling ceased,
and there came a sharp crash, as though wood
had broken somewhere.
</p>
<p>
“The chimney’s fallen!” cried Mrs. Floyd.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, Eliza,” said her husband. “The
crash would be up on the roof if the chimney toppled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
over. Besides, there’s no wind, and the noise
didn’t come from above, it came from—down
there!”
</p>
<p>
He pointed to the floor of the living room, which
was of bare boards, with rugs here and there.
</p>
<p>
“That’s right!” cried Jack. “The crash was
below us. It’s under this bungalow somewhere.
Up with the floor boards! We’ll get at the bottom
of this!”
</p>
<p>
There was no doubt on that score. Every one
in the room was sure the noise had come from
under the floor.
</p>
<p>
“But how could it?” asked Walter. “There’s
no cellar to the bungalow; is there?”
</p>
<p>
“None that I ever heard of,” said Mr. Floyd.
“I didn’t live here when the bungalow was built,
but I’ve always understood it had no cellar.”
</p>
<p>
“It hasn’t,” Cora affirmed. “At least none that
you can find. There are no cellar stairs and the
place seems to rest on piles.”
</p>
<p>
“But the noise came from down there,” and
Jack pointed to the floor. “The only way to find
out is to take up the boards. May we, Mr.
Floyd?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, I reckon so. We’ve got to get at
the bottom of this. It’s better to spoil the floor
than to lose the renting of the bungalow by ghosts
scaring tenants away. Take up the boards. I’ll
get an axe and a crowbar.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
And so, in the middle of the night, for it was
close to twelve o’clock, the strange work of looking
under the floor of the bungalow for the source
of the queer noise was begun.
</p>
<p>
“Where shall we start?” asked Jack, when Mr.
Floyd had brought the implements.
</p>
<p>
The caretaker considered a moment.
</p>
<p>
“If there is some sort of cellar, or space under
this bungalow, it must be near the center of the
floor, I’m thinking. We’ll begin there. Don’t
be afraid of spoiling the floor. I’ll take the responsibility.”
</p>
<p>
Jack swung the axe vigorously, and, being aided
by Walter, soon had removed two or three of
the narrow boards. As they were prying on another,
a queer thing happened.
</p>
<p>
A solid section of the floor from the middle of
the room suddenly sank down, and then rolled
back, exactly as a sliding door rolls, only this door
was horizontal instead of vertical. Back it rolled,
leaving what was practically a trap in the floor,
and as the light shone down this a flight of steps
was revealed leading into darkness.
</p>
<p>
“Great bumblebees!” gasped Jack. “See what
we’ve done! Uncovered a secret passage! Now
for the solution of the mystery!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—THE PATCHED TIRE</h2>
<p>
Crowding around Jack they all gazed down
into the opening. For a moment no one spoke.
Then Cora softly murmured:
</p>
<p>
“A secret passage.”
</p>
<p>
“What else is it?” demanded her brother. “No
one knew it was here. You didn’t; did you?” he
asked Mr. Floyd.
</p>
<p>
“Never had the least notion of it. How it
got here is a mystery to me.”
</p>
<p>
“It must have been built in the bungalow, or
put in after it was built,” said Bess. “What does
it mean? What’s it all about?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what we’re going to find out,” declared
Walter.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean to say you’re going down—there!”
and Belle, with a dramatic gesture,
pointed to the dark opening.
</p>
<p>
“Why shouldn’t we go down there?” asked
Paul. “It’s nothing but a cellar.”
</p>
<p>
“Cellar!” ejaculated Jack. “We’ll find this
more than a cellar I’m thinking!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, the steps are just like cellar stairs,” said
Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Except they’re of stone,” added Walter, “and
that passage isn’t going to prove as prosaic as a
cellar, I’m thinking.”
</p>
<p>
“How did you come to open it, Jack?” asked
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I can’t tell you,” was the answer.
“It seemed to open of itself when the axe,
or something, hit on the hidden spring. It’s a
secret door to a secret passage, and the land knows
what we may find at the end.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s just like in a book or a play!” gasped
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“More like a play,” said Cora. “They have
sliding doors like this on the stage where the
spirits appear and disappear.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it!” cried Jack, as if an idea had suddenly
come to him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s what?” Walter demanded.
</p>
<p>
“This is where the spirits came from—the spirits
that have been having fun with the furniture,”
Jack went on. “Don’t you see? They came up
through this secret door, did what they pleased,
and went down again, closing the door after them
by means of some secret mechanism.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re not so far wrong at that,” remarked
Paul, examining the queer sliding door in the floor
with a mechanic’s eye. “This is a pretty piece of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
work. You seem to have smashed the operating
part of it with your axe, Jack, or at least the part
of it that opened the door from this side. It
slides back and forth though,” and Paul rolled the
section of the flooring to and fro.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t close it!” cried Walter. “You might
shut it so we couldn’t get it open again. We want
to explore that passage.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what!” came from Jack. “This is
where the furniture-movers came from all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Though why they should want to upset chairs
is more than I can account for,” commented Walter.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll find out when we go down there,” suggested
Paul. “Wait until I take a look at this
apparatus. We don’t want it closing over our
heads after we get down there.”
</p>
<p>
The sliding door, or rather the section of flooring,
was comparatively simple in arrangement. It
was made so that it could be dropped down two
inches, and then it could be rolled under the floor
on small steel wheels, which ran on projecting
strips of wood.
</p>
<p>
As Paul had said, Jack, by a blow of his axe,
had destroyed the spring that controlled the mechanism,
but this very chance blow of the implement
had revealed the secret. Probably there was one
certain board which, when pressed on, or shifted,
operated the sliding door. And so cleverly was it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
fitted into the floor, and so tight was the joining,
that the presence of it would never have been seen.
Only by chance had they happened upon it.
</p>
<p>
“Well, who’s going down?” asked Jack, as they
stood looking into the opening. “We’ll need lights,
though.”
</p>
<p>
“I have my flash,” said Walter. Paul, it developed,
had his also. Both were powerful pocket
electric torches, with dry storage batteries.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll all go,” suggested Paul.
</p>
<p>
“No you won’t!” cried his sister. “We’re not
going to be left here alone, with that queer noise
likely to happen at any time.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess there won’t be any more noise, now
that we have discovered this,” said Jack, significantly.
“This is where it came from all right.”
</p>
<p>
“But what caused it?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what we’ve got to find out,” said Walter.
“Come on, boys. Into the secret passage!”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay with you girls,” said Mr. Floyd. “Let
the boys investigate all they like. But this sure
does beat me! To think this bungalow had this
concealed under the floor all the while, and I never
knew it.”
</p>
<p>
“No wonder this was named Camp Surprise,”
said Cora.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe even them folks that give it
that name suspected anything like this,” Mrs.
Floyd remarked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll take all the surprise out of it before
we’re through,” Jack said, as he started down the
stone steps. Walter and Paul followed, their
flashes switched on. The stone steps proved to
be made of cement well moulded, and there were
ten of them, which led to a flat place under the
bungalow, the floor of which was now three feet
above the boys’ heads. They found themselves
standing in a rectangular space, with heavy planks
on the sides.
</p>
<p>
“Is it just a cellar?” called Mr. Floyd from up
above, where he stood at the edge of the opening,
with the girls and his wife.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a long narrow passage leading off
somewhere,” Jack called back. “We’ll investigate.
It doesn’t seem to be just a cellar though.”
</p>
<p>
“Be careful,” warned Cora, as the boys passed
out of sight of those who were watching.
</p>
<p>
Jack, Walter and Paul found themselves in
what was practically a planked passageway, about
four feet wide and eight feet in height. There
was a musty, damp smell to it, and when they had
walked on a few feet over the hard-packed dirt
floor, Jack said:
</p>
<p>
“This goes beyond the bungalow.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“I mean that we have passed beyond the limits
of the bungalow. This passage extends back
under the ground, perhaps into the mountain.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
“Maybe right into that cave we found to-day,”
suggested Paul.
</p>
<p>
“It might be,” agreed Walter. “There’s something
queer about this—something big, too. Keep
on, and we’ll find where this passage leads to. It’s
been built some time, that’s evident.”
</p>
<p>
This was shown by the fact that the planking
on the sides and overhead was old, and rotted in
some places. And the ground underfoot was
packed so hard that it gave no evidences of footprints
or other marks.
</p>
<p>
Wondering what lay before them, the boys
pressed eagerly forward. And then, after a sudden
turn, the passage came to an abrupt end. They
found themselves up against a stone wall, a veritable,
and not figurative one.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you know about this!” exclaimed
Jack in chagrin.
</p>
<p>
“This is the end,” said Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps not,” asserted Walter. “This passage
must lead somewhere. Nobody would go to
all this work making it, only to block it off in this
fashion. And it’s blocked off solidly enough, too,”
he added as he banged his fist against the stone.
Like the steps it seemed to be of cement.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t there any way of opening that?” asked
Jack.
</p>
<p>
“There doesn’t seem to be,” Paul said, examining
it closely. “Looks to be pretty solid.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can’t be,” declared Jack. “Else how could
those spirits or boys get through and up into the
bungalow to play tricks with the furniture?”
</p>
<p>
“If they were spirits a stone wall wouldn’t stop
them,” Paul said. “But we can’t do anything
more to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Can we at any time?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” cried Jack. “We’ll get crowbars to-morrow
and tear down this cement wall. Then
we’ll find what’s at the other end of the passage.
Now come on back and tell the girls.”
</p>
<p>
They found their friends eagerly waiting,
though there was some disappointment when the
boys reported finding nothing.
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing in that passage except the solid
wall at the end,” Jack said. “But we’ll tear that
down to-morrow and see what’s beyond.”
</p>
<p>
“Now hold on a minute,” said Mr. Floyd. “Of
course I’m as anxious as you folks are to get at
the bottom of this. But I don’t own this property,
and before I let you go to work tearing down
stone walls and so on, I’ll have to get permission
from the owners.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s right,” assented Jack. “Who are
they?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Floyd gave the name, and added the information
that they, or rather the one man who
owned this particular bungalow, could be reached
by the long-distance telephone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then we’ll call him up in the morning,” decided
Jack. “I don’t know how far the passage
extends, or whether it’s all under the property
that goes with this bungalow, but we’ll get permission
before we go ahead.”
</p>
<p>
This was agreed to, and when the girls learned
that there was nothing to be alarmed at they went
down into the passage also, as did Mr. and Mrs.
Floyd.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there’s nothing more we can do,” said
Cora. “Let’s get what little sleep there is left, and
then prepare for work in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s almost morning now,” said Belle, pointing
to the windows through which they could see a
faint glow in the east, presaging the rising sun.
</p>
<p>
They were all too highly excited to sleep much,
and they were up early. Boards were laid over
the opening in the floor, it being feared if the sliding
section was closed there might be trouble in
opening it again.
</p>
<p>
The strange happenings of the night formed the
only topic at breakfast, and then the boys set off
for town to get in communication on the telephone
with the bungalow owner.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t see why he would object,” said Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Unless he made that passage for his own use,
and doesn’t want any one to meddle with it,” Paul
remarked.
</p>
<p>
“What could he use it for?” asked Walter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, that may be part of the mystery. Let’s
take a short cut to the village,” and he indicated
a path that led toward the cave in the mountainside.
</p>
<p>
They emerged into a country road, thick with
dust, and were trudging along this, talking on all
the aspects of the queer discovery, when Jack suddenly
stopped and stared intently at something in
the dirt of the highway.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Walter. “A snake?”
</p>
<p>
“No, marks of an automobile tire,” Jack answered.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing very remarkable in that,” laughed
Paul.
</p>
<p>
“There is in this one,” Jack declared excitedly.
“See the big Z mark where the tire has been
patched—vulcanized. Boys, that’s the same mark
as was on the tire of Cora’s car! I believe her
machine has been along here this morning!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span><a name='chXXVI' id='chXXVI'></a>CHAPTER XXVI—THE DROPPED BUNDLE</h2>
<p>
Walter and Paul stood beside Jack, looking at
the queer mark of the automobile tire in the dust.
</p>
<p>
“It is just as Cora described it,” said Walter.
</p>
<p>
“I remember, too,” added Paul. “She spoke
about it at the time, saying the man at the garage
had made a poor job when he vulcanized on that
patch. He didn’t know his business, that’s a fact.
But still there might be other cars with that same
sort of tire, Jack.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, but this is worth taking a chance
on. What do you fellows say?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell us first what you want to do,” suggested
Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Follow this tire mark until we either see the
car, or lose trace of it.”
</p>
<p>
“What about telephoning to Mr. Haight about
permission to rip down that cement wall?”
</p>
<p>
“We can do that, too,” answered Jack to Paul.
“This auto seems to be headed for town, and
that’s where we’re going. If we see the men who
have stolen Cora’s car, we’ll get it back for her.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“If the men let you,” added Walter, significantly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ll get help if we have to,” said Jack.
“Come on.”
</p>
<p>
For some distance it was comparatively easy to
follow the automobile track by means of the prominent
impression left by the patch on the tire.
</p>
<p>
“But if you can tell whether it’s going to town
or coming from there, it is more than I can,” asserted
Paul, “and I know something about autos.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, I’m not sure of that part of it,”
Jack admitted. “But we have to go to town anyhow,
and it won’t be any harm to go by this road,
on the chance of seeing Cora’s car; will it?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” agreed Walter. “Perhaps we can kill
two birds with one stone that way, as well as any
other.”
</p>
<p>
But the hopes of the boys were doomed to disappointment,
at least in respect to getting further
trace of Cora’s car, provided the tire marks were
made by hers. At least it was a temporary setback.
For after about half a mile there came a
patch of hard oily road, in which the impression
of the big Z was lost. And when next a dusty
stretch was encountered, there were so many marks
of automobile tires that it was impossible to distinguish
any particular one.
</p>
<p>
“Baffled!” exclaimed Walter, semi-dramatically,
after a back-aching inspection of the road.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
“Only for a time,” added Jack, cheerfully.
“After we telephone we’ll take the trail of the
marks, going in the other direction. That will
be back toward the cave, and I wouldn’t be surprised
if there were some connection between the
cave, the passage under the bungalow and the
men in Cora’s car.”
</p>
<p>
“Some cute little detective you’re getting to be,”
laughed Paul. “Well, it may be that you’re right.
Go on.”
</p>
<p>
A little later the boys reached the village, and,
after executing some commissions for the girls,
including the purchase for Bess of a box of chocolates,
they found a long distance telephone in a
drug store where there was a booth to insure privacy.
</p>
<p>
It was decided that Walter should explain matters
over the wire to Mr. Haight, the owner of
the bungalow, and ask permission of him to batter
down the stone wall that brought the secret
passage to such an abrupt end.
</p>
<p>
“And while you’re about it, Wally,” suggested
Jack, “ask him what the whole mysterious business
means, what makes those noises, and why
spirits, or humans, should have the nerve to sneak
into the girls’ rooms and upset the furniture.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d need a night letter to get all that information,”
Walter retorted. “You forget this is long
distance telephone rates I’ll have to pay.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll whack up on it,” suggested Paul. “Go
ahead, Walter, get all the information you can.”
</p>
<p>
Walter’s stay in the telephone booth was a
lengthy one. His chums only caught disconnected
murmurs of his talk, but they had glimpses of his
face through the glass door and there was sufficient
astonishment and satisfaction depicted to
whet their curiosity to the utmost.
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” Walter exclaimed as he came out.
“It was some hot in there!”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind about that!” exclaimed Jack.
“Can we tear down that wall?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” gasped Walter. “Mr. Haight was as
surprised as we were to hear about it. He’s coming
up to have a look.”
</p>
<p>
“Do we have to wait until then?” asked Jack,
in disappointed tones.
</p>
<p>
“Not at all. He said to go right ahead.”
</p>
<p>
“And doesn’t he know anything about the queer
goings on, or who upsets the furniture?” came
from Paul.
</p>
<p>
“Not in the least. It’s all news to him, though
he says Mr. Floyd did write a letter telling about
some strange happenings. Mr. Haight didn’t pay
much attention—said he couldn’t make head or
tail of the letter. He intended to look into the
matter when he had a chance, but now he authorizes
us to do it for him.”
</p>
<p>
“And couldn’t he give even a hint as to why the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
sliding door was made in the floor, and who cut
the passage?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“No, though he said something which may
prove to be a clew. He said he bought the bungalow
from a man who used to be a well-known
actor. This actor gave up the stage, and it was
rumored that he was slightly demented before he
died. Now it occurs to me that this theatrical
chap may have had this sliding door made to gratify
his whim for sudden and unexplained comings
and goings. Perhaps to frighten his servants.
Any sort of theory might explain it. That’s only
a guess, but it’s as good as any.”
</p>
<p>
“It sounds reasonable,” admitted Jack. “At
least the actor may have had the secret door built,
but the passage, which leads to goodness knows
where, looks more like the work of smugglers or a
band of outlaws.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it may turn out to be that before
we’ve finished,” said Walter. “Anyhow, we have
permission to go ahead, and the sooner we get at
it, and have that wall down, the sooner we’ll know
where we’re at.”
</p>
<p>
They hastened out of town, eager to begin work
on the wall, and were soon on the same highway
where they had seen the automobile marks.
</p>
<p>
“And this time we’ll follow them in the other
direction,” said Jack. “We might as well spend
a little time on this end of the game now as later,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
and it may be that this will fit in with the rest of
the mystery.”
</p>
<p>
“Good idea,” commented Walter.
</p>
<p>
As the boys retraced their steps they took note
of the fact that the mark of the big Z in the dust
became plainer.
</p>
<p>
“We were wrong before,” decided Jack. “We
were going in the direction from which the auto
had come. Now we’re following it.”
</p>
<p>
“To its lair, I hope,” said Paul. “I’m anxious
to get back to the bungalow and have a go at that
wall.”
</p>
<p>
“Same here,” commented Walter.
</p>
<p>
The boys were walking along, their eyes on the
ground so as not to lose sight of the marks, when
Jack, raising his head, uttered a cry that attracted
the attention of his companions.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” he cried, pointing down the road.
“There’s Cora’s car now, and two men are in it!”
</p>
<p>
There was no doubt about it. Cora’s car was
of a peculiar purple tint with maroon trimmings.
It had been made especially for her, and that it
was her machine was evident at a glance, especially
to Paul who was in the automobile business.
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” cried Jack. “We’ve got ’em!”
</p>
<p>
But had they? The automobile had turned out
of a field, against a side hill of which was built a
wooden building, like a farmer’s spring-house.
The men seemed to have been using it as a garage,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
and Cora’s automobile, occupied by two strangers,
was rapidly speeding down the road.
</p>
<p>
At Jack’s cry one of the men looked around, and
then the machine was speeded up, raising a cloud
of dust.
</p>
<p>
“No chance of catching them!” cried Paul.
“We’ve got to get another machine somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t!” exclaimed Jack. “We’ll have to
follow until we see where they go. We mustn’t
lose sight of ’em now.”
</p>
<p>
It seemed a hopeless chase, and it was, practically.
Jack distanced his companions, who called
to him to come back so they could examine the
building in the lot.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we’ll find a clew there,” cried Walter.
</p>
<p>
And finally even Jack gave up. Human legs,
even those of an ambitious youth, are no match
for an automobile. But as Jack slackened his
pace he saw something which caused him to run
forward again. For a bundle had been dropped
from Cora’s car, and the men did not stop to pick
it up.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe that will prove the best clew yet,”
thought Jack, as he hastened forward to pick it
up.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span><a name='chXXVII' id='chXXVII'></a>CHAPTER XXVII—THE GIRLS’ DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>
“Why don’t they come back?”
</p>
<p>
“What keeps them so long?”
</p>
<p>
“I declare this waiting is worse than——”
</p>
<p>
“Doing nothing,” Cora finished for Bess.
“Probably the boys can’t find the kind of chocolates
you ordered, pretty little plump maid, and
they’re afraid to come back without them.”
</p>
<p>
“Silly,” protested Bess.
</p>
<p>
“But they are a long time,” said Hazel, she and
Belle having uttered the two rather impatient sentences
at the opening of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
The girls were in the bungalow, eating, not
exactly bread and honey, but ice cream and cake,
which Mrs. Floyd had made. And they were
talking of the absence of Jack and his chums, who
had gone to town to telephone to Mr. Haight.
</p>
<p>
It was now lunch time and the girls, after waiting
in vain for the boys, had eaten, and were enjoying
their dessert. Or rather, they were trying
to enjoy it under the rather unappetizing influence
of impatient worry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
“If they don’t come back pretty soon I’m going
down there myself and see if we can discover anything,”
Cora declared.
</p>
<p>
“Down where?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“In the passage, of course. I want to see if we
can find where that queer noise came from.”
</p>
<p>
“And who upset the furniture,” added Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’re on the track of it,” said Hazel.
“We are pretty certain, now, that whoever did it
came up through that sliding door, and went down
the same way. That accounts for our never seeing
any one enter or leave the bungalow after the
manifestations, and that’s why, after the boys ran
over so promptly the time we saw the dancing
light, they couldn’t find any one. Whoever it was
just slipped down through the secret passage,
pulled the section of flooring back into place, and
there was no trace.”
</p>
<p>
“But where did they go after they got down in
the passage?” asked Belle. “They couldn’t stay
there all the while, and there’s no sign of any one
there now, unless they’re invisible. They couldn’t
get past the blocking cement wall.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s something beyond that wall, and we’re
going to find it!” declared Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps when the boys come back they won’t
have permission to tear it down,” suggested Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Then we’ll begin our investigations from the
other end,” Cora said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
“What other end?” Hazel questioned.
</p>
<p>
“The cave! I think this passage connects with
the cave. That would explain a hiding place for
whoever has been playing these tricks on us, and
making that strange noise.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean the cave you accidentally discovered
yesterday?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Cora answered. “I’m sure that has
something to do with the mystery. So if Mr.
Haight won’t let us open the wall, we may be able
to see what is on the other side by going to the
cave, and finding the passage that connects with
the one which comes out into our bungalow.”
</p>
<p>
“In that event the stone wall must be movable,”
suggested Hazel.
</p>
<p>
Cora jumped up so suddenly that she disturbed
Bess who was leaning against her.
</p>
<p>
“That’s it! That’s it!” Cora cried. “I wonder
we didn’t think of it before. That surely is
it!”
</p>
<p>
“What is?” eagerly demanded Belle. “You are
talking in riddles.”
</p>
<p>
“This whole affair is a riddle, girls!” exclaimed
Cora. “But what Hazel said gave me an idea.
That cement wall seems solid, but it can’t be. If
it were no one could pass. So it must be made to
look solid to deceive those not in the secret. Probably
it is a balanced stone like the ones you read
of in stories of the cave dwellers. Some of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
closed the entrances to their caves by heavy rocks,
set on pivots, turning when you pressed on a certain
mechanism. There are counterweights, just
as in a window, which makes the heaviest rock
move easily. I’m sure that’s what is in the passage—a
balanced rock doorway. And there won’t
be any need of tearing the wall down at all!”
</p>
<p>
“It sounds like a detective story,” commented
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“It may turn out to be one before we’re
through,” Cora said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! Why don’t those boys hurry back?”
cried Belle for perhaps the tenth time. “Let’s go
out and look down the road to see if they are coming.”
</p>
<p>
The girls went out, too anxious and too eager
to sit still, but they had no sight of Jack and his
chums.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not going to wait any longer!” exclaimed
Cora at length. “If I’m right, there will be no
need of tearing down the wall. That is, if I can
find the mechanism that turns the rocky door.
And if I’m wrong, there won’t be any harm in doing
it.”
</p>
<p>
“Doing what?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Going down into the passage to see what we
can discover. Will you come?”
</p>
<p>
“I will!” exclaimed Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Then we will, too, Belle,” said Bess, quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
“They shan’t call us cowards, even if we are
twins.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on,” cried Cora gaily. “We must do
something or fly to pieces with nerves. Anything
is better than sitting still, waiting.”
</p>
<p>
Back to the bungalow the girls hastened. The
hole in the floor was still open, the sliding door
having been braced back so it could not be closed
by any accident.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want to go down there and not be
able to get up again,” Cora remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we tell Mrs. Floyd we’re going to see
what we can find?” suggested Belle.
</p>
<p>
“No,” decided Cora, after a moment’s thought.
“She might not want us to until we have Mr.
Haight’s permission. We’ll just do this on our
own responsibility. We won’t damage the wall
any.”
</p>
<p>
Down the cement steps went the four girls,
into the dark passage. The boys had left behind
their flashlights and these were carried by
Cora and Hazel. The small, but powerful lamps
gave a good light.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh! It’s rather creepy in here,” complained
Belle, looking back over her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be silly!” said Cora, sharply. “Just
think of it! We may solve the mystery all by
ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope so,” murmured Bess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
They came to the cement wall that barred further
progress along the passage.
</p>
<p>
“First to see if it’s solid rock,” Cora suggested.
</p>
<p>
“How?” asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“By tapping. I brought along a hammer.”
With this implement Cora gave several blows
against the obstruction. An unmistakable hollow
sound resulted.
</p>
<p>
“I believe it’s only a wooden door, covered over
with cement stucco,” Cora said. “Now to find
the secret catch.”
</p>
<p>
With their flash lamps the girls went over every
inch of the surface of the door. At first it all
looked alike, dull, gray, smooth cement. Then
Cora’s light lingered a moment on a certain place.
</p>
<p>
“Girls, watch!” she said suddenly.
</p>
<p>
With her thumb she pressed on the spot where
it seemed the cement was worn smoother than
elsewhere. And then, to the surprise of even Cora
herself, the cement door swung slowly back, revealing
a dark passage beyond.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve discovered it!” cried Cora. “No need
to tear the door down. Just as I suspected, it’s
on hinges. Come on, girls!”
</p>
<p>
Hardly realizing what they were doing, the
others followed, their torches illuminating the
plank sides of the underground tunnel.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure this is all right, Cora?” asked
Belle, as she stepped beyond the open door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure anything is right about all this
mystery,” was the answer, “but this is a chance we
mustn’t miss. Come on.”
</p>
<p>
“But where are we going?” Belle queried.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell, but I think to the cave,” Cora answered.
“Don’t be afraid. There’s no danger.”
</p>
<p>
Hardly had she spoken than a noise sounded behind
them.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what’s that?” cried Belle, rushing forward.
</p>
<p>
“It sounded like a door closing,” said Hazel.
</p>
<p>
She flashed her light back on the way they had
come, and as she did so she cried:
</p>
<p>
“It was the door. It has swung shut, girls!
We’re trapped!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span><a name='chXXVIII' id='chXXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII—PRISONERS</h2>
<p>
Walter and Paul stood close beside Jack Kimball,
as he turned over the package which had
dropped from the automobile—Cora’s automobile,
to be exact.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I’m going to find out,” answered
Jack. “Feels like a package of money, if I’m any
judge.”
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” whistled Paul. “Counterfeiters, do
you think?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not so rash as to do any thinking after the
queer things that have been happening,” retorted
Jack. “I’m going to make sure before I do any
guessing. Here goes!”
</p>
<p>
He cut the string of the packet. It was well
wrapped in stout brown paper, and when Jack,
sitting down on a wayside stone and resting the
bundle on his knees, had folded back the covering,
there was revealed to the boys bundles of tickets
tied in little packets.
</p>
<p>
“What in the world is this?” asked Paul, picking
up one of the little packages. “Tickets?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
“Railroad and theatrical,” added Walter, as
he examined some more closely. “Say, this is a
queer find!”
</p>
<p>
Jack whistled shrilly and then cried out:
</p>
<p>
“It fits in! It all fits in!”
</p>
<p>
“What does he mean?” asked Paul.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” Walter answered. “Tell us,
Jack. Can you see through the puzzle?”
</p>
<p>
“Part of it. Don’t you see? These tickets—some
railroad and the others for theatres and
opera houses—they’re counterfeit—bogus—no
good! They’re just like those that girl in the
Spinning Wheel tea room bought. Don’t you
remember, she purchased two of a couple of young
fellows. It was thought at the time they might
have been the ones who went off with Cora’s
auto. Now we reverse the process. We find
the bundle of tickets that dropped out of Cora’s
car, and we see two men running away in it.
They’re the same ones, or in the same gang, I
haven’t a doubt. It’s up to us to get after them.”
</p>
<p>
“You seem to have struck it,” commented Walter.
“Do you mean these men have gone into the
business of counterfeiting tickets on as big a scale
as this?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m thinking that,” Jack answered. “You see
it wouldn’t pay to print a few tickets. They’d
have to make a whole lot of them, and in the case
of theatrical coupons, sell them quickly, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
fraud would soon be discovered. Railroad tickets
might take a little longer to prove invalid, for they
would have to go to the head offices, and there
the railroad men could tell by the consecutive numbers
that there was duplication somewhere. And
the tickets would have to be pretty well distributed—only
a few in each city.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what they wanted of Cora’s auto,”
suggested Paul. “They wanted to cover a big
area.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Jack went on. “And they probably have
accomplices in many places. Once the tickets were
printed, they had to distribute them over a wide
territory. Boys, I think we’ve discovered a daring
band of ticket-counterfeiters.”
</p>
<p>
“But where do they do their work—their printing?”
asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Why not in the cave?” asked Jack. “It would
be the most natural place around here.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with looking in that shack
where the auto came from?” asked Paul, nodding
back toward the field against a hill in which the
shed was built.
</p>
<p>
“I was going to suggest that,” Jack went on.
“Perhaps that is another entrance to the same cave
Cora found. Come on, we’ll have a look, anyhow.
We’ve got this for evidence, in any case,”
and he held up the bundle of tickets.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure they are bogus?” asked Paul.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, not positive, of course,” Jack said. “But
you’d hardly find so many kinds of railroad and
theatrical tickets, the latter for a number of different
cities, all in one bundle unless something
were wrong. I put these fellows down as counterfeiters
of tickets, and you’ll see I’m right.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll take a chance,” decided Walter.
“Now what are we going to do about getting
Cora’s car back?”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t do much right away,” said Jack.
“But those fellows will come back, I’m sure. Let’s
explore a bit in that shack, and then we’ll go and
rip out that door in the secret passage.”
</p>
<p>
The doors of the shack which stood against the
hill in the big field were fastened with a cheap
padlock, and Jack, after a moment of hesitation,
smashed it with a stone.
</p>
<p>
“Come on in, boys!” he called, swinging back
the doors.
</p>
<p>
“It’s as dark as pitch,” complained Walter.
“Did any of you bring your flash lamps?”
</p>
<p>
“Left ’em at the bungalow,” Paul answered. “I
have some matches though.”
</p>
<p>
By the glimmer of one he struck, the boys saw
that the shack was a sort of vestibule to a cave,
for a big hole extended under the side of the hill.
</p>
<p>
“Jack was right!” Walter exclaimed. “This is
a cavern, and it looks to be a good-sized one. I
wish we had a light.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
</p>
<p>
“Here’s a lantern,” said Paul, who had lighted
another match. “We’ll explore a bit.”
</p>
<p>
By the greater light of the lantern, which was
found near the doors, the boys saw that the cave
was indeed a large one, extending well back under
the hill. They went in cautiously at first, not knowing
what they might find, or what hidden pitfalls
might lie in their path.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” exclaimed Jack, pointing to several
boxes lying about. “They must have been doing,
or else are getting ready to do, lots of business.
Those boxes contain paper and cardboard by the
looks and marks on them. And now——”
</p>
<p>
“Hark!” exclaimed Paul in a whisper. They
all listened. From somewhere far back in the cave
came a dull, rumbling, vibrating noise, and the
ground faintly trembled.
</p>
<p>
“There it is again!” said Walter—“that strange
noise. Now we’ll find out what it is. Come on.”
</p>
<p>
He started forward, the others following, Paul
in the rear with the lantern, for it had a reflector
on and gave better light when carried behind the
boys.
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute!” cautioned Jack. “I don’t
seem to hear that noise now. It’s stopped.”
</p>
<p>
“So it has,” concurred Paul.
</p>
<p>
They listened intently, then Jack said:
</p>
<p>
“I hear another sound, though. It’s behind us,
toward the mouth of the cave. Boys, it’s those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
fellows coming back. Out with that light, Paul.
We’ll hide in here and surprise them. Quick!
Down behind some of these boxes!”
</p>
<p>
Paul extinguished the lantern, and he and his
companions sought places of concealment. They
could now plainly hear footsteps approaching,
while they also distinguished the murmur of excited
voices.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, another part of the strange mystery
was being enacted with the girls as principal characters.
They had entered farther into the secret
passage, beyond the queer swinging door which
had closed after them.
</p>
<p>
“We’re caught!” cried Belle. “Oh, Cora!”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps not,” said Jack’s sister. “If that
door opened once for us it will do it again. But
don’t go back. Come on. We must see what is
ahead of us. The boys will laugh if they hear we
turned back when we had such a good opportunity.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, they shan’t laugh at <em>me</em>!” declared Hazel.
“I’m with you, Cora.”
</p>
<p>
“And you may be sure we’re not going to be
left alone,” cried Bess. “Come on, Belle!”
</p>
<p>
The latter hesitated a moment, looked back at
the closed door, and then went forward. Their
lamps made the place fairly light, and they could
see that the passage was planked here as it had
been nearer the bungalow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
They had gone on perhaps fifty paces more
and were wondering when the queer tunnel would
come to an end, when Cora, who was walking in
advance with Hazel, put her hand on her companion’s
arm, and cried:
</p>
<p>
“Do you hear it?”
</p>
<p>
“Hear what?”
</p>
<p>
“That strange, rumbling, trembling noise.
Don’t you <em>feel</em> it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes! Yes!” cried Belle. “Oh, what is it?”
</p>
<p>
There was no doubt of the noise. It seemed to
fill the whole passage with a dull, rumbling roar,
and the ground vibrated and trembled.
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” cried Cora, resolutely. “It’s just
ahead of us. We will solve the mystery now!”
</p>
<p>
Willing or unwilling, Belle, Bess and Hazel followed
their leader. With their electric lights
showing the way the girls pressed forward. Suddenly
the passage turned, and, making that turn,
the girls came upon a strange sight.
</p>
<p>
Before them was an open door, which gave entrance
to a large cave with rocky sides and roof.
Vaulted and large the cave was, and from long
wires fastened somewhere in the roof hung a number
of incandescent lights. In the cave the girls
saw several queer machines, and Cora, at least,
recognized more than one of them as printing
presses. A gasoline engine was throbbing away
in one corner, and it was this, Cora decided, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
made the rumbling, the throbbing and trembling
vibrations.
</p>
<p>
Hardly realizing what they were doing, the girls
walked forward, and, passing through the open
door, entered the cave which widened out at the
end of the secret passage.
</p>
<p>
“What—what does it all mean?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
Low as her voice was it seemed to awaken
strange echoes in the vaulted cave. And at the
sound of it something stirred in one corner. From
a pile of boxes something arose—a something that
resolved itself into an old man with white hair and
a long, white beard. He peered from beneath his
bushy white eyebrows, with piercing eyes at the
startled girls, and from his throat came a guttural
cry.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, ha! Police spies—four of ’em!” he
snarled. “I thought we’d be found out!”
</p>
<p>
With surprising quickness in one seemingly so
aged the man slipped behind the girls. They
turned, fearing an attack, but they need have had
no alarm on that score. With a quick motion the
old man closed and locked the door through which
they had come.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’re here—you’ll stay!” he rasped out.
“On guard here, Bombee! Hist! Watch ’em!”
</p>
<p>
And, as he called, a raw-boned, half-witted boy
shuffled forward, and squatted, with a horrible
grin, in front of the terrified girl prisoners.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span><a name='chXXIX' id='chXXIX'></a>CHAPTER XXIX—TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<p>
Jack and his two chums, waiting in the dark
of the cave, wondered who it was approaching.
They had guessed it would prove to be the two
men who had gone down the road shortly before
in Cora’s car, but this was only a guess. And
whether these two were the same men who had
first taken the machine was, of course, only a conjecture.
</p>
<p>
“What’ll we do, Jack?” whispered Paul, from
behind a barrel where he was crouching. “Jump
out on ’em?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” was the answer. “Not at first. Let’s
see what their game is and then we’ll have better
evidence against them. Just lie low and wait.”
</p>
<p>
“Here they come!” cautioned Walter.
</p>
<p>
The sound of the footsteps and of the voices
was nearer now, and presently the boys saw the
glimmering reflection of light on the rocky and dirt
sides of the cave.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to work lively!” said a man’s voice.
“Those campers are beginning to suspect there’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
something wrong. We’ll have to clear out, bag
and baggage, presses, engine and everything.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” added another. “Lucky we
have the car. We can take most of the stuff
in that if we have time, and set it up somewhere
else. This graft is too good to give up.”
</p>
<p>
“Where’ll we take it?” a third voice asked, and
the boys, who could not see the speakers, wondered
how many of them there were.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we can stow it away at——” began the
man who had spoken first when there came an interruption
from his companion.
</p>
<p>
“No names!” he cautioned.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s to hear?”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t tell. Since those boys opened up
the floor of the bungalow, there’s no telling what
might have happened. Besides, I don’t want old
Jason to know where we are going. I’m going to
get rid of him; he’s more trouble than help.”
</p>
<p>
“Especially with that horrible boy of his,” some
one said. “Ugh! I can’t bear the creature!”
</p>
<p>
“Still he’s been useful. He did the tricks all
right. But it was a mistake to go to the bungalow.
That’s caused all the trouble. We should
have stuck to this end of the cave.”
</p>
<p>
“We had to have an emergency exit,” declared
one of the men, “and the bungalow was the best.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, until these campers came. Now that jig
is up.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the whole business is up, I’m afraid.
Well, let’s see what we can get out now before
we’re found.”
</p>
<p>
Jack and his chums could hear the men moving
about boxes and barrels. They seemed to be taking
them outside. What was in the packages the
boys could only guess. And Jack was wondering
what he and his companions could do if the men
in the cave should suddenly discover the presence
of the intruders.
</p>
<p>
Jack peered out from behind his barrel and had
a glimpse of a man moving about in the light of
a lantern the criminals had brought into the cave
with them. But the man’s legs alone were visible
and Jack could form very little idea from them
of how the man looked.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t this enough for one load?” asked one
of the men. “We don’t want a breakdown.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that machine will carry more,” declared
another. “We did a fine stroke when we picked
that up. I wonder if those girls have an idea
where their car went to?”
</p>
<p>
“They’ll have one soon,” thought Jack, gritting
his teeth. “The nerve of you!”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go back and get that little numbering
press,” suggested a man. “It’s too valuable to
leave, and it won’t take up much room. Come on,
and pick up what we can. The fewer trips we
make, the better it will be for us. Come on.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
The light flickered and the footsteps of the men
died away.
</p>
<p>
“I say Jack!” called Walter, after a moment’s
pause.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, what is it?”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with our going outside and
getting Cora’s auto now. It’s got a lot of their
stuff in it that will be fine for evidence against
them. It’s our best chance—just slip out now and
get Cora’s car.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” agreed Paul. “If we let them
get away with it again we may never see it.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed Jack. “You two go out
and capture the car. Do whatever you think best
about it. I’ll stay here and follow the men when
they come out. If they have some of their machinery
that will be additional evidence against
them. Go ahead.”
</p>
<p>
Paul and Walter hurried out, leaving Jack
alone in the dark cave. They left him the lantern,
saying they could find their way out by means of
matches. Jack felt a little apprehensive as he was
left alone, knowing that at least three men, who
might prove desperate criminals, were in the cave
with him. And if they discovered him, and knew
that he was one of those working against them—well,
Jack did not altogether like to speculate on
what might follow.
</p>
<p>
Those seeking to solve the mystery were now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
divided into three parties. There was Jack, alone
in the cave, waiting for the return of the three
men. Walter and Paul were on their way outside
to get the automobile. While Cora and her
chums were prisoners of the old man and his imbecile
son.
</p>
<p>
Walter and Paul reached the outer end of the
cave without incident, and just without the wooden
shack found Cora’s car standing unguarded and
well-laden with packages and some small bits of
machinery.
</p>
<p>
“Caught with the goods!” chuckled Paul.
“This game is coming right into our hands now.
What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Drive the car as near to the bungalow as we
can,” decided Walter. “The girls will be anxious
about us, anyhow. We can leave the car with Mr.
Floyd and then come back to Jack.”
</p>
<p>
A quick examination showed that Cora’s car,
though it had been sadly misused, was in shape
for running. It responded at once to the self-starter
and Walter and Paul were soon chugging
down the road, taking off the spoils of the ticket
counterfeiters.
</p>
<p>
“Camp Surprise ahoy!” called Walter as he
ran the car as near as he could to the bungalow.
“Girls, where are you? We’ve got great news!
We’ve solved the mystery!”
</p>
<p>
There was no answer to the hail, and Paul
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
looked at his chum rather apprehensively as they
alighted.
</p>
<p>
“They don’t seem to be here,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“They must be,” Walter argued. “There’s
Mrs. Floyd. We’ll ask her.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, aren’t the girls in the bungalow?” asked
the chaperon, wonderingly. “I have been away a
little while, and just got back. They were here
when I left.”
</p>
<p>
A quick search through the bungalow failed, of
course, to disclose the presence of Cora and her
chums. The entrance to the secret passage was
still open, but Walter, running down the steps, reported
that the girls were not there, and that the
blocking door was closed.
</p>
<p>
“But we’ll soon have it open,” he said. “We
have permission from Mr. Haight to tear down
the obstruction.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is Mr. Kimball?” asked Mr. Floyd,
who had been summoned by his wife from a bungalow
not far away, where he was making some repairs.
</p>
<p>
“He’s up in the cave, keeping watch on the counterfeiters,”
said Paul. “It’s a great story!”
</p>
<p>
Thereupon he and Walter gave a short account
of the movements of themselves and Jack up to
the present.
</p>
<p>
“But where are the girls?” asked Paul. “We
must find them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps they went up to the cave Cora found,”
suggested Walter. “Let’s go there and look.”
</p>
<p>
“First we’d better see if Jack doesn’t need
help,” Paul said. “I guess the girls know enough
to keep out of danger, and it’s daylight yet. We’ll
go to Jack.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take charge here,” said Mr. Floyd. “I’ve
got a man working with me at the other bungalow,
and he and I will stand guard over the auto.
When you come back, if the girls haven’t returned,
we’ll go after them.”
</p>
<p>
This plan was deemed the best to follow, and
Paul and Walter hastened back on foot to the cave
where they had left Jack.
</p>
<p>
Cora and her friends, made prisoners in the
cave by the old man and his horrible, grinning,
half-witted helper, felt faint and sick as they realized
what might be the outcome. For a moment
none of them spoke. The old man laughed, showing
his blackened teeth—a strange contrast to his
white beard—and then he chuckled:
</p>
<p>
“Police spies; eh? Come to catch the old man!
But he was too smart for ye; wasn’t he? He
caught you; didn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean by locking us in?” demanded
Cora. “Open that door at once and let
us go!”
</p>
<p>
“And call away that—that horrid idiot!” half-sobbed
Belle. “If he catches hold of me——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bombee won’t hurt you; will you, Bombee?”
said the old man, patting the half-witted
youth on the head. “That is, he won’t if you do as
I say, and don’t try to run. Bombee’s like a dog.
He’s my pet, so he is. Hi, Bombee! Do a trick
for the ladies!”
</p>
<p>
The idiot gave a shrill cry, bounded up on a
box and stood on his head, his legs kicking in the
air.
</p>
<p>
“See!” chuckled the old man. “Bombee minds
me. If I was to tell him to bite you he would, but
I won’t tell him.”
</p>
<p>
“You let us go!” demanded Cora, her thoughts
in a whirl with the strange ideas that came to her
mind.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t ask you to come here,” snapped the
old man. “And them as comes uninvited must
stay until they’re let go. Ye can’t go out and bring
in the police.”
</p>
<p>
“But if—if we promise not to tell the police?”
faltered Bess.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t trust you,” snarled the old man.
</p>
<p>
“Then there must be something here about
which you are afraid,” said Cora, boldly. “Why
do you fear the police?”
</p>
<p>
The man gave her a sharp glance.
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind that,” he said. “When the
others come I’ll know what to do with you. I’ll
make you——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
He paused and seemed to be listening. At the
same time the idiot gave a whimpering cry.
</p>
<p>
“Some one’s coming!” snarled the old man.
“The police, maybe. You’ve sent ’em. But they
won’t find you. Quick, Bombee—the secret room—open
the door!”
</p>
<p>
The half-witted creature bounded forward, and
caught up a club. Bess screamed, fearing the
fellow was going to attack them. But the idiot
merely put the stick in a hole in the wall, and
pressed on the lever with all his might. A heavy
plank door swung out, revealing a black room.
</p>
<p>
“Into that with you!” cried the old man.
</p>
<p>
“No!” screamed Cora.
</p>
<p>
“In there with you or I’ll——”
</p>
<p>
He looked so terrible, and made such a threatening
gesture, and the half-witted youth seemed
so ready to do his master’s bidding that the girls
shrank back from the claw-like hands of the old
man, and fairly ran into the secret room opened
by the helper. Once inside they heard the door
close after them.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Belle. “This is terrible, Cora!
What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Keep quiet a minute. Let me think. Oh, oh!”
</p>
<p>
Hazel flashed on her light.
</p>
<p>
“Thank heaven for that!” moaned Belle. “We
can at least see.”
</p>
<p>
The girls looked quickly about them. The light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
showed them that they were in some sort of office.
There were desks and chairs in it, and on the
desk were a number of papers, while innumerable
tickets were scattered about. The girls attached
no significance to them at first. There was an incandescent
lamp swinging above the desk, and
Cora turned the black key. At once there was
light, showing that the gasoline engine, the rumble
of which could still be heard, operated a small
dynamo.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what shall we do?” gasped Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” whispered Cora.
</p>
<p>
From the cave outside came the murmur of excited
and angry voices. There followed sounds
of great activity, as if boxes and barrels were being
moved about. Once or twice came a snarl
from the idiot, and the commanding voice of the
old man. The other voices the girls could not
recognize.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to call for help,” said Cora. “That
may be the boys come to rescue us. Come on, girls!
We’ll all shriek!”
</p>
<p>
This they did, uniting their shrill voices in an
appeal for help. Cora caught up a paper-weight
from the desk and hammered on the door of their
prison. But neither their calls nor the pounding
brought an answer. The noise in the outer cave
continued. The men seemed to be quarreling
among themselves now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
Then came silence. The girls called again but
with no result. They listened. Not a sound came
from beyond the door.
</p>
<p>
“What has happened?” asked Bess.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t even guess,” Cora said. “But don’t
worry. We’ll get out of here some time. Meanwhile,
let’s see if we can by any means open the
door.”
</p>
<p>
Events were now happening in several different
places—events connected with the boys and the
counterfeiters.
</p>
<p>
Jack was waiting in his hiding place, wondering
what would next take place, and he was getting
rather tired of his cramped position, when he
heard footsteps coming back.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s where I do a sleuthing act and follow
them,” he decided. But he was hardly prepared
for what followed. The footsteps broke into a
run, and there were excited voices calling one to
another. There was the crash of falling boxes,
and above everything came a strange unearthly
yell, like that of some animal in pain.
</p>
<p>
“What in the world——” began Jack.
</p>
<p>
There was a rush of several bodies past his hiding
place. Jack looked up over the head of the
barrel in time to see four men, one carrying a
lantern, dash along the cave, and behind them
came another with abnormally long arms.
</p>
<p>
Pausing a moment to allow the fleeing ones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
to get a little ahead, Jack followed. His brain
was excitedly thinking.
</p>
<p>
“There’ll be a grand ruction in a minute,” Jack
chuckled to himself. “Things will happen with a
vengeance.”
</p>
<p>
He heard cries of rage from the shack at the
mouth of the cave. Advancing into it, but keeping
himself concealed, Jack peered out. He noted
that the automobile was gone, and from the absence
of Paul and Walter he argued that they had
driven away in it.
</p>
<p>
The talk of the men confirmed this.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve dished us!” exclaimed one, angrily.
</p>
<p>
“The car’s gone!” faltered another. “We were
too slow!”
</p>
<p>
“What are we going to do?” asked a third.
</p>
<p>
“Cut and run for it!” some one answered. “The
game is up. Scatter, and we’ll meet again, later.
Lively’s the word!”
</p>
<p>
Jack looked out to see the two men he and his
chums had observed before, with a third one, start
for the wooded slope of the mountain. Then he
saw the old man and the half-witted helper.
</p>
<p>
“Wait—wait for me!” pleaded the aged one.
“I can’t run fast, I’m all crippled with rheumatism!
Wait!”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t wait. Look out for yourself,” one
man flung back unfeelingly over his shoulder. “It’s
every one for himself.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah! desert me, would you!” cried the old man,
shaking his fist at the fleeing ones. “But I’ll get
even with you. Old Jason will get even! I’ll let
the girls out of the cave, and tell them the whole
story! I’ll let the girls out of the secret room in
the cave!”
</p>
<p>
Jack had been in two minds whether to advance
and speak to the old man, or follow the fleeing
ones, but as he heard these words he knew something
else now called for his attention.
</p>
<p>
“The girls in the cave!” he murmured. “It
must be Cora and the others he means. They
must have gone into the cave while we were in
town. I’ve got to rescue them. Let the men go!
I must help the girls.”
</p>
<p>
Catching up his lantern, Jack dashed back into
the dark cavern.
</p>
<p>
“I’m coming, girls! I’m coming!” he cried.
“To the rescue!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span><a name='chXXX' id='chXXX'></a>CHAPTER XXX—ALL’S WELL</h2>
<p>
Walter and Paul, hurrying to aid Jack, whom
they had left in the cave, came in sight of the
shack just as the old man and his helper were
turning back into it. The two boys did not glimpse
the three fleeing men who had by this time disappeared
among the trees.
</p>
<p>
“Look—look at that!” gasped Paul, rubbing
his eyes. “Am I dreaming, Wally, or is that an
ape or a human being?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s real enough—some sort of a crazy chap,
I should say. But what’s he doing?”
</p>
<p>
“Calling down the vengeance of heaven, I
guess,” observed Paul, for they saw the old man
shaking his fist in the air.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry up and we’ll speak to him,” urged Walter.
“Somehow I think he’s part of the mystery.”
</p>
<p>
They reached the old man just as he was turning
back into the shack. He did not seem greatly
surprised to see them.
</p>
<p>
“Will that—er—fellow hurt us?” asked Walter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not unless I tell him to. Are you the police?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but we can get them if you wish,” said
Walter. “We are after the ticket counterfeiters,”
he added shrewdly. “We have recovered the
stolen auto, and a lot of the stuff is in our possession.
Now if you——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ll give up. I’m too old to run away.
They deserted me, and I’ll tell all I know. I’m
getting tired of it anyhow. Being a criminal
doesn’t pay. I’ll give up. Come on back and I’ll
let out the girls. I’m sorry I locked them in, but
I thought there was a chance to escape. I didn’t
hurt them.”
</p>
<p>
“Girls! What girls?” gasped Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess likely they’re of your party—from
the bungalow,” said the old man, from whom
all the spirit of rage and fighting seemed to have
gone. “They’re in the secret room of the cave.
Come on, Bombee, we’ll let them out.”
</p>
<p>
Wondering what it all meant, Walter and Paul
followed the old man back into the cave. He
seemed to know his way in the dark, though Walter
had brought an extra flashlight from the bungalow,
and now switched this on.
</p>
<p>
A little later the two boys, with the old man
and the half-witted helper, entered the main cave
where they found Jack running about half wild
with excitement. He was shouting, and muffled
cries—the voices of the girls—came in answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jack! You here!” cried Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and the girls are here too, but I can’t locate
them, though I can hear them. They’re
locked in some secret room. We must find it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll let them out,” said the old man. “I locked
them in. Hi, Bombee, open the door.”
</p>
<p>
Once more the powerful helper took up the
wooden club, or lever. He inserted it in the opening
and the plank door, which could not, at first
glance, be told from part of the cave sheathing,
swung open. Then, tearful and disheveled from
their efforts to escape, out rushed the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Jack!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh Paul!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh Walter!”
</p>
<p>
Thus they gasped, the two girls seeking refuge
in their brothers’ arms, while Belle and Bess clung
to one another.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that horrible man!” gasped Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Bombee won’t hurt you,” said the old man,
humbly. “And I ask your pardon. I had to do
what I thought best, but it is all over now. I give
up!”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s get out of this terrible place,” begged
Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, then,” returned Jack. “Why, it’s
a regular underground printing shop,” he added
as he looked around. “Here’s where they made
the counterfeit tickets.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, this is the place,” confessed the old man.
“You have found our secret.”
</p>
<p>
Walter and Paul started to go out of the cave
the way they had come in.
</p>
<p>
“There is a shorter way,” said the old man.
“It leads to your bungalow.”
</p>
<p>
“But that door is shut,” said Cora. “It shut
after us.”
</p>
<p>
“Bombee can open it,” was his reply. “He
knows the secret as well as I. Come. It opens
easily.”
</p>
<p>
He led the way back along the passage through
which Cora and her chums had lately come, first
unlocking the door which he had closed after them.
When they came to the cement obstruction, the
helper pressed on a certain place, and it swung to
one side. A little later the entire party was in the
bungalow, to the great surprise of Mr. and Mrs.
Floyd. The caretakers looked in astonishment
at the old man and his assistant.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now let’s have some explanations,” suggested
Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Did you get the auto?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and a whole lot of tickets and other stuff,”
Paul said.
</p>
<p>
“My auto?” asked Cora.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we have it back for you,” answered Walter.
“And before we lose any more time we had
better get the police after those three men.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go into town,” offered Mr. Floyd. “And
about him?” he nodded to the man the counterfeiters
had called Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll give myself up,” the old man said.
“Old Jason is tired of the game. Lock me up
whenever you wish,” he seemed very tired and
weary. “I won’t run away. I’ll stay with Bombee.”
</p>
<p>
A little later the authorities took charge of
matters, entering the cave and taking possession
of a very complete though small printing plant,
and numberless bogus tickets. Constables were
sent to look for the three men. The old man was
arrested and taken to jail, and Bombee, his son,
who would not be separated from him, went with
him. But before Jason was taken away, he told
enough to make the mystery clear.
</p>
<p>
He was an expert printer, it seemed, and had
fallen in with a band of men who planned to flood
the country with bogus railroad and theatrical tickets.
They had set up their plant in the cave, the
existence of which they had learned by accident
and kept secret.
</p>
<p>
There were three entrances to the cave. One
was in the side of the hill, where the men had put
up a shack in order to conceal the opening. The
second was the one discovered by accident by Cora.
This was not used, being too small. And the third
was through the bungalow and the passage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p>
This passage, the secret sliding door in the floor,
and the cement door that blocked the passage
(it developed later) had been constructed by the
actor who formerly owned the bungalow. Just
what his object was no one knew, but his unbalanced
mind probably built a romance about the
great dark hole. The cave was then used for
nothing, but it admirably suited the purposes of
the ticket men who fitted it up as they wished.
</p>
<p>
To it they brought their machinery and began
issuing tickets, Jason, aided by the half-witted
Bombee, doing the printing, while the others distributed
the product. It was the rumble and clank
of the gasoline engine and presses that made the
queer trembling sounds heard by the girls and
boys. The rocky cave acted as a sort of telephone,
or sound box, and sometimes the noises would be
louder than others. The fact that the engine stood
on a strata of rock upon which the bungalow was
constructed accounted for the trembling and vibration
of the building.
</p>
<p>
“We did the printing when you folks were away
from the bungalow at most times,” said old Jason.
“We found out when you were gone by means of
the secret passage. But sometimes we had to work
on a rush order when you were on hand.”
</p>
<p>
“Then is when we heard the noise,” said Jack.
</p>
<p>
“But who upset the furniture, and took our
things?” asked Cora.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that was Bombee,” said the old man. “I
could not always watch him, and he would slip
away, open the secret door of the passage and get
up into the bungalow through the floor. He is
very mischievous, but gentle. He likes to upset
chairs and tables. He used to do that trick, among
others, in a theatre where he used to show as a
human ape. He didn’t look unlike an ape, you
see.”
</p>
<p>
“He took your ribbons and things, too. They
are in the cave. I thought they came from your
bungalow, but I did not dare return them. Once
he brought in a flashlight.”
</p>
<p>
“That was the time we saw the queer, dancing
beams upstairs and down,” said Hazel.
</p>
<p>
Before our friends had occupied the bungalow,
Bombee had been up to his tricks. He had upset
the furniture, giving rise to the strange stories
about Camp Surprise, and he it was who had taken
the silver, having a love of bright things. He
would slip out of the cave, open the passage door
(having seen Jason operate the mechanism), get
into the bungalow by means of the opening in the
floor, upset the furniture and then run out through
the passage again, closing the doors after him,
so there was nothing to show how any intruder
had gotten in and out.
</p>
<p>
It was learned that the time the boys and girls
saw the two men at the tumbled-down old house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
that the counterfeiters had gone there to meet some
persons to whom they gave bogus tickets to dispose
of. The men probably realized that our
friends were on their trail and fled. The taking
of Cora’s car had been done on the spur of the
moment, the need of some means of getting quickly
about the country to dispose of the tickets being
pressing.
</p>
<p>
The crash heard in the night, which caused the
floor to be taken up, was caused by one of the men
dropping a box of tickets. He was storing it in
the passage near the secret door. Occasionally,
when the bungalow was not occupied, the men used
it, and it was in this way that the big, half-witted
youth learned to find his way there.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess that ends the surprises of this
camp,” said Cora, as the officers took Jason away.
“Now we can enjoy our stay here.”
</p>
<p>
And the surprises were indeed over. The secret
door in the floor was closed, and fastened, the
mechanism having been broken. After the printing
apparatus had been taken out our boys and
girls, and many others inspected the cave. It was
a large and curious place, and the criminals had
made it their living and hiding place for some time.
</p>
<p>
Though a diligent effort was made to capture
the three men, they were not apprehended, and in
view of his confession Jason was given only a light
sentence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
</p>
<p>
Cora’s recovered car was put in good order
and used some, though the mountain roads were
not very good for automobile riding.
</p>
<p>
“And now for some glorious times!” cried Bess
one day, about a week after the mystery had been
cleared up. “Boys, we’ll give you——”
</p>
<p>
“A big chicken dinner!” interrupted Jack.
“That’s what we want.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you deserve it,” said Cora, “for the
clever way you laid your plans.”
</p>
<p>
“You girls were a bit clever too, getting into
the cave by the secret door while we were off in
town telephoning,” said Walter. “We give you
the credit for that.”
</p>
<p>
“Everything came out all right all around,” remarked
Hazel. “But, oh! we were scared stiff
for a while.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say so!” ejaculated Belle. “That
horrible old man and his awful son!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, all’s well that ends well,” said Bess.
“And I have a whole box of chocolates to go with
the chicken dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“Marvelous—a whole box!” echoed Cora.
“How did she ever manage it, girls?”
</p>
<p>
The chicken dinner was voted a great success.
By this time the summer season was in full swing,
and many cottages and bungalows in Mountain
View were occupied. Cora and her friends entered
with zest into the jolly life, and they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
the recipients of much attention, for the story of
Camp Surprise had been told in many papers.
</p>
<p>
“But it’s nicer not to hear queer noises and see
strange lights,” said Cora. “And it’s a relief to
come in and find the furniture the way you left
it.” And the others agreed with her.
</p>
<p>
“Will we ever have another time like this?”
asked Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps. Who knows?” returned Cora. And
leaving that question to be settled later we will
say good-bye to the Motor Girls.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
